# Support-Vector-Machine

Simple implementation of support vector machine based on sequential minimal optimization(smo) algorithm.
optional kernel: linear, gaussian(rbf), polynomial(poly).
X -> two dimension data set.
y -> one dimension data set.

Data is better to process in numpy array.
the numpy array must be set to 'int' if data is in an integer format, 
otherwise unpredictable error will happen during process
