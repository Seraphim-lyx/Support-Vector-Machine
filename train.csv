243bf497a426ef3f,""" Calling for a movement to eliminate Biritsh spelling on wikipedia This is a very serious issue that needs to be confronted. It is not professional, non-NPOV, and inconsistent that we have some articles with British spelling, and others without. There are even some articles that deal with something thats exclusively American, such as the White House for example, that have some words spelled the British way. This should not be, and there should be some uniformity if we wish to have a professional and reliable encyclopedia.Britian is the only English-speaking country that uses their own unique variation of the English language, and in British contexts, that's usually fine. But every other English-speaking country used the standard spelling, which is generally based on how the word actually sounds, and that should be the standard that Wikipedia uses. It makes absolutely no sense to use one country's variation of dialect, no matter how BIG, important, or """"popular"""" it is, and completely disregard the rest of the English-speaking world's orrect usage of the language. In fact, pretty much every article that contains a word that differs between the two dialects, the British version is favored. This, also, makes absolutely no sense. If the majority of a population speaks and/or writes a certain way, then it's institutions, endorsements, and websites should speak/write that certain way, too. It is understandable if this website was: www.wikpedia.co.uk, because that assumes that this is a primarily UK website. But, this website is: www.wikipedia.com, so it should follow the standard dialect that other """".com"""" use. This isn't in any way some sort of hate movement or opinion. This is an encyclopedia, and in encyclopedias, information must be consistent and reliable.

Readers should be aware of the relation between the terms.  ?receding unsigned comment added by 192.246.234.74   It's redundant. Egotistic- and egotistical-suicide are the same thing.   That is the point to stating that it is """"also known as"""" the other term.  The words are not the same: egoistic refers more to a general self-centered nature while egotistical refers more to a self-centered way of thinking and speaking.  Look up the terms and you will see that they are not perfect synonyms.  The implications of both terms on the semantics and the basic message of Durkheim's theory is significant.  This information - a matter of 5 words - should be included in Wikipedia's article.  Both are valid terms with different implications.  It would not be the first time a Wikipedia article lists multiple terms for the same thing.According Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary they're the same words. 'He performed an egotistic suicide for egotistical reasons', same thing.   Unless that was a typo, you just used exactly the same word twice.

249735a2af2480b2,"Hi.  I will work through an example for you.  In most Western economies, money borrowed to invest is tax deductible.  In other words, you are only taxed on net profits associated with a business or investment venture such as a 'carry trade' in assets, cash, bonds, or commodities.So let's say the hypothetical 'carry trader', as typically depicted in the financial media, is borrowing Yen at 0%, and investing in US treasuries or overnight repos at 5.25%.  Sounds like a profitable trade, right?  Read on.Now, consider that said trader pays a marginal income tax rate of 40%.  And consider that Japan has been in deflation for the past number of years, at deflationary rate of -1%.  In the same time period, US inflation has been running at roughly 2.5%.The 'real' cost after-tax cost of Yen = nominal after-tax cost - rate of inflation.The 'real' return on USD assets = nominal after-tax returns - rate of inflation.So, for the Yen borrowing, the calculation is 0% * (1-40%) = 0% - (-1%) = 1%And for the USD investment = 5.25% (1-40%) = 3.15% - 2.5% = 0.65%So the real rate of return on USD investment is 0.65%, while the real cost of Yen borrowing is 1%.  Since the real cost of Yen borrowing exceeds the real return on USD investment, a so-called 'carry trade' should not have an expectation of profit.Hedge funds and other institutional players are usually intelligent enough not to engage in activities that do not have expectations of profit.Therefore, it can be argued that all the talk in the financial 'media' or even in the 'Economist' about a so-called profitable 'carry trade' is complete nonsense.  It is true that there might be some speculators who have placed (and done well with) bets against the Yen in recent years since the bubble burst in the 90s, but to confuse such with a profitable 'carry trade' defies logic.",0,0,0,0,0,0,

24b026f672d91353,""" I need an advocate and help with mediation Greetings,I need an advocate who will walk me through the mediation process.I am trying to get the following added to the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.  Max Tegark is a renown physicist and a PhD profressor of cosmology at MIT.  He agrees with my addition.I am having problem with an editor by the name of Lethe who follows me around Wikipedia reverting all my edits without commentary.I have tried reasoning with him on discussion pages, but he refuses to read what I write.Advantages of MWIIf Hugh Everett's theory was just another interpretation of Quantum Mechanics it would have no followers, especially since it proposes the existence of countless other universes which theoretically can never be observed. Because it is not falsifiable it seemingly violates Popper's criteria for a good scientific theory. The reason it has so many adherents is because it offers numerous advantages over the Copenhagen Interpretation, among which are the following:1. Quantum mechanics becomes a deterministic theory making it more compatible with the theory of relativity and all other physics theory to date which are all deterministic. The Copenhagen Interpretation introduced indeterminacy and randomness into science. Aside from the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics there is no scientific theory that includes indeterminacy or randomness. Einstein particularly objected to this aspect of the Copenhagen Interpretation. In response to it, he said, """"God does not play dice with the universe.""""2. It eliminates the """"measurement problem.""""3. It eliminates Von Neumann's """"boundary problem"""": where to draw the line between the micro world where quantum mechanics applies, and the macro world where it does not. Shortly before his death in 1953, Albert Einstein wrote: """"Like the moon has a definite position whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects.""""4. It eliminates the special place for an observer and human consciousness.5. It restores objective reality of the universe between measurements. Shortly before his death, Albert Einstein also wrote: """"Observation cannot CREATE an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the possibility of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made.""""6. The wave-particle duality paradox evaporates. It simply and naturally explains the double-slit experiment. Richard Feynman said, """"[the double-slit experiment] has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality it contains the only mystery."""" David Deutcsh wrote: """". . . the argument for the many worlds was won with the double-slit experiment.""""7. Schrodinger's Cat paradox evaporates.It seems Einstein's main objections with quantum mechanics had more to do with the Copenhagen Interpretation, than with quantum mechanics itself. While MWI does not quite generate the kinds of worlds necessary to justify the anthropic principle, it is a step on the way to Stephen Hawking's No Boundary Proposal and Max Tegmark's All Universe Hypothesis which do justify the anthropic principle.

Major erosion of beach areas. Terrain may be flooded well inland."""" 55% of all buildings in Innisfail damaged. Entire banana crop and some of sugarcane crop demolished. Rooves stripped of countless buildings; some buildings flattened entirely. Extensive flooding. Universal power outages, sewage system fails. Airports closed for the day. Storm surge4.0?.5 m5.0m 1-minute average sustained winds210-245 kph 200km/h confirmed. Otherwise unknown, with gusts frequently exceeding 280kph. Conclusion Larry is indeed a category 4 cyclone at the very least, unless we are willing to ignore important factors for the sake of 10km/h of confirmed sustained wind.I already have an article (American) claiming it was Cat 4. It's right [here. However, as you stated earlier, newsgroups are not an authority on the matter, are they? As for my friend , well what can I say to you? You have gone against all sound logic and called me a liar because I can't confirm 10km/h of sustained wind. I'm unsure if you even know what logic is. To you, it's all cold hard data, with stupidty thrown in for free. Your level of intelligence sickens me. You've also failed to note the case for central pressure, which was on par with most Cat 5 storms. What you're proposing is this: """"A cyclone that brought about more than the effects and damages of a typical Category 4 storm and that had the Central Pressure of a typical Category 5 storm, is in fact a mere Category 3, simply because it's confirmed/measured sustained winds were 5 knots below the """"cut-off"""" for Category 4.""""For the rest of you: SS scale uses 1-minute averages. A 1-minute average of 200km/h was RECORDED about 30km north of where the cyclone crossed. I understand this is 10km/h less than the cut off for cat 4 (as stated above), but at least it puts estimates and what-nt to rest. Further, I'll leave the rest of my argument to logic, that is, if you have any.Listen to me very carefully. Beauty may fade, but dumb is forever.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Yes, it's said to be more accepting than the """"proud Teutonic"""" approach to English identification, although it seems as though the Celtofascists here are trying to spin the English alone as """"foreign"""" to the Isles, even though it is easy to discover the Celtic origins in Roman Europe, especially the Brythonic kind (as much as Anglo-Saxon European ties are to the post-Classical Rome of Charlemagne and other Holy Roman """"Germanics"""").  They think that pro-Celtic, pro-Roman means hostile cultural appropriation, as they have identified you as """"the other"""", the big pink elephant in the room.  It is a sight for sore eyes to see how you manage to reconcile hostile, """"mutual-exclusionary"""" factions of Celt, Roman and German, for most """"people"""" involved in these articles have one agenda to push or another, but hardly any singular Romanists, I'm afraid.

Take a look at #138  it isn't issued to Colt, it has nothing to do with guns, and it was issued in the wrong year. Then take a look at X9430: for a revolver, issued to S. Colt on Feb. 25, 1836. (For both of those, you have to enter the number of the patent you want to see, then click the option to see images  there are no transcriptions, but they have scans of the original documents.)The link I gave above  X-Patent  discusses the patents that were destroyed. Prior to 1837 (and the fire that destroyed the patent office's copies of those first patents) patents weren't numbered. After the fire, in 1837, the Patent Office started numbering all new patents, beginning at 1. They also started trying to recover extant copies of old patents, and numbering them as they found them, but beginning with X1. So pre-fire (1836 and earlier) patents are X-series, post-fire patents don't have the X. The patent Colt was issued in 1836 was an X-series patent, because it was issued before the fire. Anything without an 'X' can't be the right patent number for that date.When sources conflict, we need to go with the primary sources above secondary sources. And the actual scans maintained by the Patent Office are about as primary as we can get on this issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0,

As I understand it, a ban is something imposed on a user by the community appointed Arbcom or Jimbo Wales by fiat for whatever reason, and a block is something any admin does to an individual user account or IP address for predetermined reasons (usually vandalism, sometimes immediately if the vandalism is severe or offensive enough, or in the case of continued actions by users blatantly against policy in the face of multiple warnings). They can both be for a set time or permanent. Bans can be permanent, blocks of user accounts can be permanent, but we don't like to permablock IP addresses. As in the case of Jessica, I blocked (what I believe to be) her IPs for 6 mos., so it ever gets reassigned to another computer after that time that computer can conceivably register for a new user account. Known shared IPs are blocked for much less time. Admins are supposed to use Arbcom mandated block ranges to enforce bans, but don't themselves declare bans on other users in order to block or have other admins block. That way, admin actions can be reversed by other admins or even by themselves if they change their minds, but bans """"from above"""" can't be lifted by admins.

In the midst of the mid- and long-distance service improvements as are already mentioned in the article, I feel this ought to be commented upon. At the time I thought it was a temporary measure and that the ultimate aim was to improve the suburban service (longer platforms, higher frequency, stops at both South Ruislip and West Ruislip, trains with faster acceleration ?in short, something approaching an Overground-style service), but, as of May 2014, that hasn't happened and despite all the excitement about the Mainline service to Birmingham, the service has worsened significantly for the short-distance user. 92.40.248.181",0,0,0,0,0,0,

I agree with Gamaliel and Nomoskedasticity that this is a BLP issue and that using """"Filipino"""" alone is utterly unacceptable and POV.   I do think """"Filipino-American"""" correctly describes the subject of the article, and is not an indication of citizenship, but rather it is a demographic description which could accurately be used.  However,  per TheRedPenOfDoom, and MarkBernstein, I think that this may be best handled as Bbb23 and Seb suggested - and how the lead is now worded - which is to not use either identifier in the first sentence, but instead unpack it, spell out in more detail the actual facts in an NPOV manner, in the lead and in the rest of the article which the intro summarizes.  This works and does not take sides in the serious BLP issue.  We further make clear how Vargas self-identifies, which I think is important here, without having Wikipedia editors take a position. As MarkBernstein said, we are not required to indicate nationality or citizenship in the first sentence or anywhere, and TRPoD is right about disclaimers etc.  -sometimes it is best to go at it from a different angle. We also had the same kind of issue at - believe it or not - Bee Gees where there were warring factions who disagreed about whether they should be called English, Australian, or Manx; we handled it by leaving off the nationality, and the wars stopped.

College, DiphuAssam, IndiaThe present study is related different geometry of the Hall thrusters in which I have tried to get better results than the simple Hall thrusters available at present with the future next generation device Duo Triad Tokomak collider (DTTC) hub by the using new type of code Diffusion Associated Neoclassical Indigenous Hall Assembly (DANISHA).Hall thrusters were studied independently in the US and the USSR in the 1950s and '60s. However, the concept of a Hall thruster was only developed into an efficient propulsion device in the former Soviet Union, whereas in the US, scientists focused instead on developing girded ion thruster. Two types of Hall thrusters were developed in the Soviet Union:(A)Thruster with wide acceleration zone, SPD (Russian), SPT, (Stationary Plasma Thruster) at Design Bureau Fake. (B) Thruster with narrow acceleration zone, DAS in English: TAL, (Thruster with Anode Layer), at the Central Research Institute for Machine Building (TsNIIMASH).   Soviet and Russian SPD thrustersThe common SPD design was largely the work of A. I. Morozov. SPD engines were operated since 1972. They were mainly used for satellite stabilization in North-South and in East-West directions. Since then until the late 1990s 118 SPD engines completed their mission and some 50 continued to be operated. Thrust of the first generation of SPD engines, SPD-50 and SPD-60 was 20 and 30 mN respectively. In 1982 SPD-70 and SPD-100 were introduced, their thrust being 40 mN and 83 mN. In the post-Soviet Russia high-power (a few kilowatts) SPD-140, SPD-160, SPD-180, T-160 and low-power (less than 500 W) SPD-35 were introduced. SPT-100 has a life time of 8000 hrs, efficiency of 52%.Soviet and Russian DAS-type engines include D-38 and D-55. Soviet-built thrusters were introduced to the West in 1992 after a team of electric propulsion specialists, under the support of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, visited Soviet laboratories and experimentally evaluated the SPD-100 (i.e., a 100 mm diameter SPT thruster). Over 200 Hall thrusters have been flown on Soviet/Russian satellites in the past thirty years. They were used mainly for station keeping and small orbital corrections. Currently Hall Thruster research, design, and theoretical modeling are led by experts at NASA Glenn Research Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A considerable amount of development is being conducted in industry, such as Aerojet and Busek Co.This technology was used on the European lunar mission SMART-1 and is used on a number of commercial geostationary satellites. What's a Hall Thruster?    The Hall thruster is a type of plasma-based propulsion systems for space vehicles. The amount of fuel that must be carried by a satellite depends on the speed with which the thruster can eject it. Chemical rockets have very limited fuel exhaust speed. Plasmas can be ejected at much higher speeds; therefore less fuel need be carried on board. The Hall thruster was invented in the late 1950's. Until the mid 1990's, it has been developed primarily by the Russians. During the past 30 years, the Russian placed in orbit more than 100 Hall thrusters. However, the vast majority of satellites worldwide have relied on chemical thrusters and, to a lesser extent, arc jet thrusters and ion thrusters.    A conventional electrostatic ion thruster consists of two grids, an anode and a cathode, between which a voltage drop occurs. Positively charged ions accelerate away from the anode toward the cathode grid and through it. After the ions get past the cathode, electrons are added to the flow, neutralizing the output to keep it moving. A thrust is exerted on the anode-cathode system, in a direction opposite to that of the flow. Unfortunately, a positive charge builds up in the space between the grids, limiting the ion flow and, therefore, the magnitude of the thrust that can be attained.      In a Hall thruster, electrons injected into a radial magnetic field neutralize the space charge. The magnitude of the applied magnetic field is approximately 100-200 gauss, strong enough to trap the electrons by causing them to spiral around the field lines in the coaxial channel. The magnetic field and a trapped electron cloud together serve as a virtual cathode. The ions, too heavy to be affected by the field, continue their journey through the virtual cathode. The movement of the positive and negative electrical charges through the system results",0,0,0,0,0,0,

The policy that actually applies to this page is WikiProject Musicians, and it does not say anywhere that the article should include """"all albums where Mayer is a primary contributor."""" (or any other artist).  The policy there is rough and incomplete.  Thus, I have been operating on precedent, as well as what makes the most sense and what is most fair to the works.  Works done by a band should be credited to the band as a whole, not an idividual, since that just isn't fair.

And it is not constructive to to add biased, unneutral opinions like Yepes was the most """"notorious""""...Second, it is a well-established fact that RAMIREZ and Yepes invented his ten-string guitar. As I said, Bernabe was an apprentice at the Ramirez shop then, but the first Yepes-type ten-string guitar was a RAMIREZ guitar. Moreover, Ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d'amor with multiple string resonators INSIDE the body of the guitar. This was rejected by both Segovia and Yepes as impractical. It was Yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only 4 strings tuned a very specific way (C, A#, G#, F#) alongside the normal 6 strings. You want a verifiable source? Here: Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. """"The Ten-String Guitar"""" in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. [ISBN-10: 8487969402]Third, I clearly said Yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings! F# or G# are very often played fretted rather than open! I have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact """"worthless"""" because it disproves your ignorant (unconstructive) remark about Yepes' """"short hands"""" being a reason for playing a 10-string guitar. Furthermore, Yepes frequently uses the 7th fretted (because it is the lowest string), but not """"frequently"""" the 8th (as you mistakenly claim), which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string. Moreover, these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non-guitarist composers like Ponce or Rodrigo that are impossible on the 6-string (except in the edited versions). Being able to use open strings as """"crutches"""" for a lack of technique was certainly NOT part of Yepes's entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar - though (I will add) many ten-string guitarists today (who are second-rate guitariats in general) have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. This has NOTHING to do with Yepes's own performance practice on his instrument. As someone who has studied for over a decade with one of Yepes's leading (long-term) students, as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the 10-string guitar, as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations, I can safely say that I know what I am talking about. Yepes even frets A2 and G2# on the 10th string rather than play them on the open A2 and G2# strings (5 and 9) in an example I have in his own handwriting, and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely MUSICAL and not about any technical limitations, which exist only in your imagination!, you know nothing.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,

When I was and undergraduate studying Balkan history I thought I knew quite a bit about Croatia; but as I study more about Croatia, one by one """"facts"""" that I knew before turn out to be dubious, based on questionable sources or no sources at all. Most of the existing literature in western languages on medieval Croatia is extremely poor; and frequently it is marred by nationalistic bias.Much of the information about medieval Croatian history comes from later (seveneenth- and eigteenth-century) narrative histories. These were written by enthusiastic people but ciontain a mixture of fact and legend; and since many of the documents they based their works on are now lost, it is extremely difficult to judge wheter their information came from reliable source or not.

The small kngdom, born in the tenth century, streched from the Kapela mountains to the Adriatic sea, its center being Biograd, located on the coast....King Demetrius Zvonimir, who, not being a member of the ruling dynasty, obtained his throne throug election, asked Pope Gregory VII fo a crown in 1075, and, in return, declared his kingdom as a papal fief. After his death, Ladislaus laid claim on his realm by the right of his sister, Zvonimir's widow, and had no difficulty in taking possession of Croatia in 1091. He bestowed the new kingdom, together with royal title, on his nephew, Almos, son of Geza I ...I further entertained myself reading yet another great discoveries of contemporary Croatian historians (soc.culture.yugoslavia) ....The exclusive revelation is the result of """"scientific"""" research by Croatian historian Dragutin Pavlicevic, and found its place in history books.

He affirms that in North Carolina """"a tribe has been living for more than 4 centuries differing in the color of skin, hair and facial features from other tribes"""". According to the same historian this is not surprising because the members of these tribe """"have the noble blood of ancient Croats from Dubrovnik in their veins"""". Mr. Pavlicevic also speaks about the Mateo Indians, named after their ancestor Mateo - a Croat named Mate.

In my experience, lists are great for their purpose, and as a power Wikipedia user and editor, I've derived enormous benefit from them - and our users probably derive much more benefit from an article like Comparison of smartphones than the benefit which is derived from, say, the dozens of references I've added to articles like Tort, Trust law, or Economics and hundreds of much lower traffic niche topics.

25d644fcdbaffc12,""" Attempt at close of old RfC That is, the RfC listed on Archive 4 of this talk page, """"RfC: Does the article minimize the centrality of India to the notion of caste?"""" That the discussion wasn't closed earlier is of little surprise: it is long, it is technical, and the older it gets the less appetizing it gets: such discussions are very much not like Parmigiano-Reggiano. In fact, the discussion is so long that you'll have to accept the general conclusions I think I was able to draw without my being able to point at each and every individual comment supporting it. What I, as a non-Hundi-Indian currently middle-class college professor, conclude, are the following points:Scholarly consensus appears to be that the caste system is still of the greatest importance to Hindu India; vice versa, discussions of the caste system in secondary and tertiary scholarly sources note the centrality of Hindu India to the very concept of """"caste"""".Scholarly and especially less scholarly discussions on the concept of caste in other societies, esp. those outside SE Asia, mostly seem to use the term in the """"broader"""" sense signaled in various places in the RfCas a convenient shorthand for """"social stratification"""" and such. I note also that the application of the term """"caste"""" to some other cultures, popular until the 1970s and perhaps after, has now come under (academic) scrutiny and criticism.Considering those two points, I conclude that it is The 1 September 2012 version of the article does suffer from OR and some coatracking; the current version is much better in that respect, though far from perfect. Note, for example, the very loose use of the word """"caste"""" in this newspaper article to warrant the inclusion of Cagot. As it turns out, there are sources """"comparing"""" their segregation to that of the Indian caste system: such a comparison is perhaps valid, but does not itself warrant calling them a caste.Allow me a few observations and suggestions.""""Caste"""" should (and this is supported in the RfC) include extensive discussion of the situation in India.Examples from other cultures (some of which well established and verified in the current version of the article and associated main articles) must of course be thoroughly verified; an article from The Independent cannot suffice for what is, after all, an encyclopedic article.I believe it is imperative (and comments in the RfC and elsewhere in the talk page archives support this) to come to a clarification of terms. The current lead does some of that already, but a separate section is warranted. Etymology should be the least important part of such a section; more important is a history of the usage of the termnot to be able to list every example of its usage, but rather to sketch the attractiveness of the paradigm to scholars of various periods, an attractiveness that has by now lost some of its currency. Parts of the lead of the 1 September 2012 version point to that as well; what's important is to delineate the term and its currency. Fowler&Fowler; cites Balkin in the RfC (""""social stratification in the United States does not really match the technical definition of caste ... caste is at best an effective hyperbole"""") and it's precisely that kind of research and criticism that need to be used here.Sourcing should continue to be scrutinizedin Caste system in India, I read """"Caste is neither unique to Hindu religion nor to India; caste systems have been observed in other parts of the world, for example, in the Muslim community of Yemen, Christian colonies of Spain, and Japan"""", with one reference possibly very outdated (1972) and another a newspaper article from the New York Times. This is an article in which Wikipedia's crowdsourcing """"hey it's in the paper let's add it"""" needs to be held in check.In all, I believe this was an interesting discussion in which the participants are perhaps closer to consensus than they thought. It is clear that there is no consensus that the article is redundant to Caste system in India etc.; it's clear also that there is consensus that the article should be much more focused than the 1 September 2012 version was, and that India must occupy a position of great(er) importance. In various places various quantified suggestions were made; I cannot comment on those numbers. I sensed some hesitance at perhaps """"borrowing"""" material from Caste system in Indiawell, if that's where good content on the concept of caste, its history, and its usage can be found, that's where you go.

The longitudinal studies indicate the importance of further research on how many schizophrenia patients profit from continuous administration of antipsychotics over a prolonged period, what factors identify and separate schizophrenia patients who do not need prolonged antipsychotic treatment, and whether or not prolonged use of antipsychotics is harmful for some or many patients.The above-cited longitudinal results from many different countries and different types of schizophrenia patients provide data bearing on issues about long-term treatment. Discussions by Whitaker, Moncrieff, and others question long-term antipsychotic treatment.25?7 These disparate views, research by WHO and DOSMED in developing countries,12 and our own longitudinal studies5? should be considered as prompts for further long-term outcome research on this important issue.  This is not a strongly worded conclusion, where our article presents as fact what this article appears to be raising as an important question in need of further study.  I continue to believe this is not a strong enough source for the cited text.  Clearly, further research on this controversial matter is needed.  Can we either eliminate this source or reword the text to better match?  The strongest conclusion of this paper is that further study is needed.  Regards,  (Talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0,

I thought it was interesting.I've never before seen someone else write about an """"American ethnicity"""" the same way I have thought about it. I know that the Southeast has the greatest number of people declaring their ethnicity as American, but I think this ethnic label would apply to the majority of racially White Americans and not just those in the Southeast. The Americans (outside of the South) that descended from pre-20 c. immigrants from the UK, Ireland, and Germany seem to have substantially = meshed together into a """"White ethnic group"""", not just racially, but ethnically as well.The only cultural differences between ethnic Whites of the North (where 19c. immigrants mostly settled) and those of the South is that the South still experiences religion and social conservatism as very influential forces on daily life. Where for the more recent ethnic Whites, this is not the case (e.g. in the North). So, the distinctive cultural aspects of the South have not been adopted by the ethnic Whites of the North even with several centuries having passed. I do not want to make false generalizations, however this is my sense of the average situation in those regions based on my travels and time spent living here. The areas where distinct ethnic identity has been conserved is in the major cities. The city-centred ethnic groups in the US have preserved a substantial part of their culture in absence of preserving their language (for the most part). A few well-known examples would be the Irish- and Italian-Americans of the Northeast. So long as their numbers are high enough to have a large enough community - cultural traditions endure. What I am getting at is that so long as a Ukrainian-American stays in a major city s/he has no reason to be forced into completely adopting a new ethnicity. S/he won't have to abandon the culture of his/her community. If s/he were to move to an area in the Southeast, then it would be a completely different story. I'd like to give you a further illustration - the Poles of Chicago. Most arrived somewhere between the 1850s and 1940s or so. Many have had families there for well over a century. There has been very limited migration out of Chicagoland for this period and the Polish community there has remained extremely strong. So there is not much past observation that would suggest that cities are only an entry point from which ethnic communities later break-down as they go their own ways. I've written all of this to demonstrate how the """"ethnic Americans"""" and people who ethnically (not racially, but ethnically) identify as """"White"""" are distinct ethnically from the more recent (post-1850) European ethnic communities in the major cities. I find it all very interesting. The only problem that sometimes arises is when individuals do not make the distinction between an """"Ameican""""/""""US citizen"""" and an """"ethnic American"""" and in so doing sometimes end up labeling certain individuals as being un-American. These people, that do not make the distinction, show frustration when a person does not abandon his/her culture and adopt their own. This is of course on an individual-by-individual basis and I would not generalize this in any way to any region or sub-region.I've seen ethnic hostilities projected towards myself or family/friends from people of all sorts of backgrounds. I've seen it demonstrated by Southerners, New Yorkers, and even Jews in South Florida. By the way, most of the time my ethnicity (and that of family/friends) would have been indeterminable by those people. I'm saying this because I don't want to suggest that any particular regional group of Americans is more racist/discriminant than another region. I've spent a lot of time in South Florida and the racist attitudes that come from some of the people there have been really surprising at times especially when you take into account that many of those racists that I have come across would themselves been the target of racism less than 50 years ago. Its all unfortunate and these types of racist, discriminatory, and nationalistic attitudes are probably present in most countries. The good part about our differences is that ethnic Americans and newer Americans have no trouble in cooperating with one another when it comes to maximizing profit. This is not the case in say many areas of the former Yugoslavia or in the areas where ex-Yugoslavs have settled throughout the Western world.Sorry for the lack of brevity.

Will he go after the WWE Championship ?currently held by Randy Orton ?and look to regain the title he never lost in the ring from a man who never beat him for it?

On Sunday, the Big Red Machine will defend the title in a Triple Threat Match against Big Show and Mark Henry. While the World's Largest Athlete remains on SmackDown, the World's Strongest Man was pulled to ECW in Wednesday's Supplemental Draft, and is that brand's chance to bring the title back to the Land of the Extreme. But, if Triple H, Edge and Big Show have an extremely good Night of Champions, SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero could conceivably find her brand the home of all three World Championships, with both Raw and ECW left out in the cold.""""Morrison's reign (Fast Forward to 3:30) """"These accolades are only fitting of a true champion, and I have an accolade that very few people in sports entertainment can claim.

262684e1d74ba93d,""" Remedies These were removed from the article. While I agree that this had developed severe listcruft, surely some citations exist for some of these. Moved to talk page so people have an idea what to search for.Potentially beneficial remediesAspirin: - acetylsalicylic acid, taken before turning in to bed (before, not after sleeping), might be effective. Consuming 3 grams of Butyl hydroxy toluen (BHT) prior to drinking is said to counter hangovers, by detoxifying acetaldehyde (presumably replacing gluthatione.)  BHT in this case is supposed to also block alcohol metabolism, so the person will stay drunk longer. Another possible remedy is the consumption of motion-sickness medicine or over the counter allergy medicine.  Specifially, consuming cetirizine prior to consuming alcohol is reported to counter the hangover.Supposed remediesNote: Most of these have not been scientifically tested or reviewed in the above articles. Water: this has been recommended scientifically. Hangovers are mainly dehydration; therefore drinking water before, during and after a drinking session will greatly decrease any hangover symptoms. A glass of water between each alcoholic drink is the best way to reduce hangover, as you won't easily become dehydrated; this also causes you to drink fewer alcoholic beverages. Drink as much water before sleeping as possible (within reason). It may not totally prevent a hangover but it will reduce headache. Continuing to drink water may help to alleviate symptoms more quickly. Nux vomica (homeopathic remedy) Milk Thistle Angostura bitters and soda water Defecation Vomiting Professional massage, reflexology (foot), and other detoxifying practices. A glass of buttermilk. Though many people dislike buttermilk, it will calm down your stomach and add liquid to the body. Having sex (or masturbation) may increase the release of endorphins, which in turn may help reduce the effect of a hangover. Drinking coffee or other caffeinated beverages.  Caffeine increases the effectiveness of analgesics, and therefore may reduce headache severity when used with aspirin or similar medicines.  Coffee has also been shown in some studies to have a protective effect on the liver, effective in preventing alcoholic liver disease. (Caffeine is a diuretic, which would further dehydrate the body. This is generally not a recommended remedy. Thus, tea, especially green tea, is indicated.) Nicotine, once again much like caffeine, increases the effectiveness of analgesics and its stimulant effects diminishes many hangover symptoms. Cabbage leaves or tomato juice Bloody Mary Michelada (popular in Mexico; one part tomato juice, one part beer, a few drops of Worcestershire sauce and/or Maggi sauce or Soy sauce) Mixing in a tall glass two raw eggs with pepper, Tabasco sauce, and gin. Although the cysteine in the egg yolk may have a mild benefit, the pepper, Tabasco, and gin will have a negative impact.  Colloquially known as a """"Prairie Oyster"""". Drinking more alcohol is scientifically proven (see hair of the dog), a well-liked remedy. This will, however, only delay the hangover  Eating seafood is a popular """"remedy"""" in Chile. Coca Cola or Pepsi-Cola, otherwise known as """"Black Aspirin"""" (popular in Australia), also """"The Red Ambulance"""" (South African); the caffeine, bubbles and sugar can be easier to hold down than pure water.  Moreover, the low pH helps the enzymes in the stomach and the sucrose partially compensates the inhibition of the gluconeogenesis.  Taking a shower and oscillating between extreme cold and hot temperatures.  This practice has no effect on the hangover and can be unhealthy. Seen in the movie The Princess Bride. Eating canned asparagus before going to bed, purportedly a good cure thanks to the diuretic effects of asparagus.  Again, diuretics compound the problem. Ginseng tea is given to relieve the effects of alcohol.  If useful, it may be for its antioxidant and-or vasodilatation / microcirculation properties. Drinking a couple of table spoons of olive oil is said to be of great helpCommon folk medicine has a wide variety of supposed hangover cures. A good hangover cure should replace essential nutrients lost by the body while counteracting the influence of residual poisons; very few cures do both at once.

He has no grounds or factual element to support his theory in general, which is pure conjecture and supposition. What's more, it's not his place within the rules of Wikipedia editing to mount a personal editorial based on his personal feelings towards a person. His hypothesis that a rouge IP editor from San Diego mounted a campaign to raise the profile of Geraldine Edwards to the level of Bebe Buell, slander Mary Ambrose, and attach Geraldine Edwards to the creation of Almost Famous is so preposterous as to be laughable.Other Wikipedia editors who have tried to defend Geraldine Flemming-Mueller against Binksternet's attacks upon her were met with threats leveled by him. His interest in Geraldine Flemming-Mueller is unhealthy and alarming, and it would be in his best interest to step away from this situation altogether, as he fails to maintain a neutral stance, which is one of Wikipedia's precepts, on the subject of her. That being said, Geraldine Edwards is not a 'hoax', she's simply a woman who's living the life she see's fit, and is not interested in being included in Wikipedia articles. And finally, posting any inappropriate, hostile information against a living person that may harm them is clearly being flouted by Binkstenet's many malignant comments posted on Wikipedia's pages regarding Geraldine Edwards, one of the main guiding principles of Wikipedia. It's time for him to stand down.The San Diego college angle is still quite active with regard to Geraldine Edwards; see User_talk:Zabadu#Geraldine_Edwards_is_not_a_hoax which was started by the IP 130.191.109.76 registered to San Diego State University.[17] This writer said """"Approximately a couple of years ago when Mary Ambrose was visiting San Francisco, she met Binksternet, and they became friendly,"""" a statement that is complete bunk. Nothing in the IP's post is supported by reliable sources.All of this effort to defame Ambrose and build up Edwards is astonishingly trivial. It is a waste of my time, a waste of Mark's time and a drag on Wikipedia to have to deal with it. As long as there are no reliable sources to back up the allegations, they must stay out of the encyclopedia. Editors who repeatedly disrupt Wikipedia are usually blocked. Binksternet (talk) Whatever. Binksternet gives new credence to the phrase """"Legend in his own mind"""". Although I respect many Wikipedia editors for their diligent, accurate and commendable contributions, Binksternet is not numbered among them. In no way will I and many others link his name to veracity and credibility. His deny, deny, deny style reminiscent of certain members of the government is amusing if nothing else. Unfortunately, this diatribe has impressed me with nothing of any value. This matter is settled and over and done with, and this is the last time I will edit on this subject on these pages. Thank you to Mark Arsten for acting in a competent, intelligent and unbiased manner here, and my apologies to him for any potential problems my editing may have caused him regarding this subject. Thank you. ?Preceding unsigned comment added by 174.77.220.178 (talk) Just so you know - I am nowhere near San Diego, haven't been to the college EVER and am not using an alias.

Translations do not have to be professional quality; They just have to be sufficient enough for the reader to understand how the cited source supports what is written in the article.

That doesn't mean you can never edit the article, but it does mean there are certain limitations placed the type of edits which are considered OK for you to make. COI editing is not expressly prohibited, but it can be a bit tricky to do so it is something which is highly discouraged. It might be a good idea for you to take a look at WP:PSCOI to see what these kinds of edits are. Of course, what you know about the museum is true, but what can be verified through independent reliable sources matters more to Wikipedia than what we may personally know about a particular subject. The information on the museum's official website is considered to be a primary source, so it's usage is rather limited. Wikipedia articles are not really supposed to reflect what a source says about itself or what those connected to the source say about it; Rather, articles are supposed to reflect what independent reliable sources say about something.

It is also rather obvious about the romantic Pocahontas connection to ideas of Roanoke survivors, in discussions of Virginia.  These things are dismissed as fancy, but they are distinct beliefs of those who attempt to put a face on what the Melungeon community has had as an inception.  So you see, I am an extreme skeptic to the fantasies described by ignorant rednecks...but I do in fact think they are relevant to the beliefs of those promoting the Melungeon identity.  One need not endorse a belief of association, but merely allow others to see what sort of identities Melungeon life has acquired.  I am confident to declare that there is so much myth obfuscating the reality of what life is like in Appalachia.  Appalachian culture is from the Deep South to Maritime Canada.  Melungeon culture is centred on the Gulf coast and south of Bermuda on the Eastern seaboardoriginally Spanish areas.  People think that just because impoverished Scotch-Irish on the frontier dressed in buckskin and furs, that they were some """"noble savages"""" (though they were not Cherokee, but in fact Andrew Jackson's henchmen).  So many ideas here wreak of Crank (person) nonsense.

Are you sitting in a trailor right now, trying to deny your Jerry Springer lifestyle?  Civil War's Reconstruction is a real bitch?!That white Spanish territory is the Melungeon core, in true history.See here:Hispanics contributed Melungeon heritage, via Louisiana and Florida colonies.  This was much different from slave owners who raped slaves to make more slaves.  Melungeons were basically the first Hispanics in the United States, whom often lived in secret or adapted to Anglo ways.  Please, do not spread fantasies as facts in this article!

2689d81ac5d49a46,""" Dispute I noticed there's an edit war going on with regard to the debunkingprimaltherapy link, and the link at the end of the """"Primal Therapy"""" section.My opinion is as follows. I think the link at the end of the """"Primal Therapy"""" section should lead to the """"Primal Therapy"""" article, not to the criticism section specifically. I feel that way because the section in the page entitled """"Primal Therapy"""" is relevant to the entire primal therapy article (including the criticisms) and not to the criticisms alone.It would be quite possible to have both links at the bottom of the paragraph (""""see Primal Therapy, including the criticism section...""""). I wouldn't be opposed to that. Personally I don't believe that the section """"Primal Therapy"""" should be on the biography page at all; we should have a link only: """"Arthur Janov is the creator of (linked) Primal Therapy, and author of many books on that subject"""". IMO there is no need to discuss primal therapy (or its criticisms) in any detail on a biography page, because those things are not biographical details. They are not relevant here. They belong in the Primal Therapy article, and there is no need to repeat that article here.With regard to the DBT.com link. I don't believe this page is an appropriate place for any kind of dispute about Primal Therapy, one way or the other, since this article is not about Primal Therapy. I don't believe that we should include here links to any sites unless they are specifically relevant to the biography of Arthur Janov. If we do have any such links  (like the DBT.com link) then we must revisit the whole debate here, and we must include other links, otherwise we violate NPOV by representing only one side. It would be better just not to have such links.Bear in mind that Art Janov is an exceedingly minor historical figure. His biography should be only a few paragraphs. It's not really the best place for an extensive argument.I realize you guys are concerned about people being led astray by reading the wiki, but I really don't think that's a major concern. Anyone who follows a """"Primal Therapy"""" link and reads the article will realize that Primal Therapy has been criticized. The readers aren't dense and don't need things repeated. In other words, I don't think anyone could be misled or led astray by a simple link (and nothing more) on the biography page.We should achieve some kind of consensus before editing the article. If we can't achieve consensus then we should solicit outside opinion.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Since the failed deal, the Vance brothers were forced to do business with the Mendez brothers. This was around the time the Vances built their own organization in power, taking over businesses from rival gangs. Victor did help with a transgender get things straight and met Phil Collins and his manager. At first, it was believed that the Mendez Cartel wanted to establish a business relationship, but their real plan was to have the Vances give their businesses to the Mendez? and leave Vice City, or the Vance brothers and Louise would die. When they refused, the Cartel kidnapped them and took them near the Escobar International Airport. The brothers blew the death row and stopped Mendez? men from taking over their businesses. Their plans were foiled. They kidnapped Louise and threatened to kill her if the brothers didn? leave the city. Not long before the Vances storm into their mansion in Prawn Island. Lance was held hostage, while Victor proceeded through the gangsters and killed Armando Mdo Mendez. Louise was left on the floor dying, next to Lance. A vengeful Victor formed an alliance with Ricardo Diaz (a crime lord) to bring down the Mendez? operations once and for all. Victor invaded into the military base, stole their army helicopter, and returned it to Diaz? mansion in Starfish Island. Once back in the chopper, Victor said he would owe Ricardo nothing and was doing this for him. After that, he flew to the Mendez penthouse and killed all the Mendez henchmen at the building in downtown. Jerry Martinez arrived in the scene and was prepared to kill Victor. Finally at the rooftop, in the final confrontation, Jerry Martinez cornered Vic, believing he was too easy to trick. Diego Mendez came and the final shootout between the 3 men led to the deaths of Diego and finally Jerry. Lance came into the scene and but it was already over. The Vance men decided to lay low with the drug money they made to take care of their sick brother outside the country. Vice City became the major spot for the drugs trade, it attracted several criminal organizations to be interested, including the Mafia. Liberty City? Mafia-linked Forelli family sent Tommy Vercetti, wh who was recently released from prison after a 15-year stay, down ?outh?to get started with their expansion, with Vercetti as a Forelli representative, just to keep him out of Liberty City. Upon arrival to Vice, Tommy and 2 other men (later learned to be Harry and Lee) met Ken Rosenberg, a bent lawyer with Forelli connections, at the airport. They soon met with the Vance family leaders at the docks to make the deal. However, 3 masked men killed everyone but Tommy, Ken, and Lance who managed to escape without the money and drugs. Tommy informed Sonny Forelli about the incident. An angered Forelli demanded that Tom found his money and drugs immediately and get those responsible for the incident. Rosenberg feared to suffer consequences from the mob and refused to stick his head of his office. Sonny called periodically to check up on Vercetti. A man for information was Kent Paul, who gave info about a chef. Tommy killed Leo Teal, who failed to squeal about the ambush. With nowhere to go, Colonel Juan Garcia Cortez, who also set up the deal, was his way in to find the money. H He was at his most expensive yacht. Cortez had a feeling that his right-hand man Gonzales squealed about the deal and was to be killed, and met Lance Vance. Vercetti met Avery Carrington, a Southern gent who was into prime real estate. Tommy met Ricardo Diaz, now a powerful coke baron. After watching a deal, Diaz offered Vercetti work since he liked his style. Soon after working for him, Lance and Tom discovered that Ricardo was responsible for their busted deal. Lance attempted earlier to avenge his brother but failed only to be captured and taken to the city? junkyard before Tommy came to the rescue. Before they could their revenge, Tommy escorted Colonel Cortez out of the city after a corrupt French government was after Cortez for assigning Tommy to steal their merchandise earlier. The men finally stormed in the Diaz? mansion grounds and killed the drug master. Diaz trusted and was going to have him made, but he was made by the 2 men. Tommy took over all his local businesses. The Forellis sent Vercetti some support, later forming his own organization in the progress while gaining power. Tommy decided to go solo and form alliances with Cuban (now in feud with a Haitian gang) and biker gangs, including Love Fist. He owned a protection racket, several assets, including the Malibu, a Pole Position strip club, a porn studio, Kaufman Cabs Company, a car dealership shop, a boatyard down the docks, and a printing company, and in progress making acquaintances with other powerful people of the criminal underworld.

For instance, in British Columbia and Alberta, Doctors of Podiatric Medicine (D.P.M.) still exist. In Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Yukon,and N.W.T standards are slightly higher and are based on quackery-based charlatan British Chiropodists who insist on calling themselves """"Podiatrists"""". In Manitoba, for example, about 15 or so quack Chiropodists insist on titling themselves """"Dr."""" despite having bogus (3-4 year) qualifications. This disgusting Manitoba movement is designed to blur the distinction between British Chiropodists and USA DPM's. In the province of Ontario, MAJOR differences in scope of practice exist. Consequently, there is still a title distinction between UK chiropodists and USA DPM podiatrists ( ie. American Doctors of Podiatric Medicine). Unfortunately, both share a governing body, the College of Chiropodists of Ontario. To accelerate Ontarians into confusing U.S. trained podiatrists with bogus UK """"podiatrists"""", the British Chiropodists who are in greater number, heavily lobby the provincial Government regularly into perpetuating & maintaining the banned prefix """"Dr."""" and the associated title """"podiatrist"""". Unbelievably, and quite maliciously, British Chiropodists have lobbied provincial legislators into forcing all USA DPM's who migrate after 1993 into accepting and only using the title chiropodist. This is plainly maliciously designed so that the Ontarian public cannot distinguish the vast difference in educational qualifications.

27593a123ad68116,"""Merged with PentateuchI merged this article with Pentateuch; there was nothing in the Pentateuch article that was not already in the Torah article, so there wasn't much point in making the distinction. If the article were to be recreated, I would suggest that attempts be made to focus specifically on that term as opposed to the Torah. podous  Dates and Wellhausen I think this edit  by  should be pulled, at least pending further consideration:It must be noted that Wellhausen's knowledge of Jewish literature outside of the Bible was limited, and led to his considerable confusion in event chronologies and dating. Notably he supposed the receiving of Torah was dating from about 1450 BCE, and that of monarchy, established by Saul, c.1020 BCE, and the (later) prophets, 9th to 5th centuries BCE.[ Julius Wellhausen ] In the case of the first the date in Jewish chronology is established as 1313 BCE, Saul is dated to 879 BCE, and Isaiah during 619 BCE. [pp.33,47,53, Kantor]These dates are based on Seder Olam Rabbah.  But a literalist reading of that book would give the destruction of the Temple in 423 BCE   way after the accepted dates for eg the Battle of Marathon (490 BC) or Xerxes' invasion of Greece (480 BC); so a wholesale new chronology for the entire history of Classical Greece would have to be found  which nobody seriously believes is credible.  (See Missing years (Hebrew calendar).So people who use the Seder Olam Rabbah dates (though not eg chabad.org ) generally adjust them to make the destruction of the temple match its date in the Babylonian records, viz. 586 BCE.  Adding that shift to Kantor's dates gives 1476 BCE for the Exodus, 1043 BCE for Saul, and 782 BCE for Isaiah (compare Chronology of the Bible).  Modern views tend to revise the numbers down very slightly (see eg Kingdom of Judah).  So Wellhausen's dates still match contemporary scholarship pretty much exactly.Furthermore, what is important for Wellhausen's history is the relative dates of these events.  Even if one prefers not to add the absolute date shift, it makes no difference to the relative chronology of the events, and the relative dates between them.I don't think therefore that this can be seen as a substantive objection to Wellhausen.    I'm not sure I have ever seen Wellhousen mentioned to have been familiar with Seder Olam.You seem to be well versed, so I need not explain to you how Greek chronology is rather problematic in itself.What modern academics do with dates to support their individual hypothesis about record keeping in various ancient cultures is of course their province, but this particular subject, if it is to be consistent, can not be """"adjusted"""" to match sources outside of its innate culture, or time, never mind that many academics who postulate the chronologies you suggest are neither Jewish, nor even monotheistic. I note that the Missing years (Hebrew calendar) completely lacks citations, so its hard to say who and how argues for """"the modern secular dating"""". In any case, I will make sure to include a link to that article and will try to fix the citations in it.Chronology of the Bible article, besides being likewise poorly cited, has four other templates at the top {{confusing|date=June 2008}}{{disputed|date=June 2008}}{{refimprove|date=June 2008}}{{totally-disputed|date=June 2008}}{{Cleanup|date=April 2007}} however, I will get to that also eventually. This article is about the Torah. Textual criticism is really not the place for it given the volumes of published works on the subject, so I'd like to keep that short. My point with the dates was to illustrate that not all 19th century theories about the Torah were well founded.Meieimatai The dates need not be """"scholarly"""". They come from a source consistent with the method by which chronology has been established within the culture for which this text is held as the core source of social construct. I'd say that it has every right to adopt whatever dating it desires for its purposes.

However, they are never blocked for this.  Since, according to you, """"being an asshole to people who disagree with you"""" is a blockable offense, it follows that one of the following must be true:Calling someone a """"vandal"""" does not constitute being an asshole, in which case I should not have been blocked because by calling deletionists (who disagree with me) """"vandals"""", I was not being an asshole to people who disagree with me.Your statement that it is unacceptable to be an asshole to people who disagree with me is false, in which case I should not have been blocked because assholery is in fact not unacceptable behavior.Or perhaps you meant to say that because someone disagrees with you is not ipso facto sufficient reason to be an asshole to him.

278bd73ab9d4657e,""" I don't get it. So if someone would be to travel through time, their actions would have no effect?But time travel itself affects the past  you're taking something from the present and putting it in a different point in time, thus, for the context of the earlier point in time you travel to, introducing matter/energy/whatever that didn't exist there before, thus (as per chaos theory) possibly screwing up everything. Any successful travel through time would have an effect, otherwise it wouldn't be time travel.With that in mind  does the principle boil down to """"time travel is only possible if it has no effect, thus time travel (the possibility of which necessitates having an effect) is not possible""""?The matter and energy of which the time traveller (and his clothing, etc) consists would (if the universe is a closed system) have been in use by something else at an earlier point in time and thus a re-allocation of matter and energy already existent at that earlier point in time to recreate the time traveller doesn't seem to be a viable alternative either. But if the time traveller can neither be composed of matter and energy that didn't exist, nor of that which already existed but was """"in use"""" already, what does he consist of?Even if the universe is not a temporally closed system (i.e. matter/energy can vanish and re-appear at future points in time), for something to vanish in the present and re-appear in the past, it would have to vanish before its original appearance unless it can't exist twice at the same point in time (i.e. if atom A was sent back in time from a point Z to a point X, it would vanish at point Z (now) and appear at point X (back then) as A', but have to vanish again as time advances closer to the point Y (somewhere before point Z) where it was originally introduced as A, otherwise A and A' (which should be identical) would exist at the same point in time, which would definitely be an alteration of past events and thus incompatible with the principle.I'm assuming the principle isn't based on the simplification of the idea that the only thing that """"matters"""" is the action/inaction of humans (as in the interpretation of Schroedinger's experiment that the cat is in an unknown state where it is both alive and dead until the human interacts with it  which implies the human's perception determines the state of reality). If that is true, then the example from Twilight Zone where someone goes back in history to start the fire he travelled back in time to prevent is clearly contradictory as it introduces a paradox (a time travel having to have occurred in order for the time travel to occur) unless it actually changed the events (i.e. originally the fire would have been caused by something else), which would still be inconsistent with the principle which doesn't allow for any changes of the past.I'm aware this post is getting a bit rant-y, but I'm seriously at a loss here. How does time travel NOT change the past, regardless of whether it has any consequences in the grand scheme of things or not? The very concept of travel backwards through time is that one appears at an earlier point of time, thus changing the past.The only possibility I can think of for time travel not to change the past is a paradox in which the time travel happens because it has already occurred (i.e. the future representation (person A') of someone (person A) appears in the present and at some future point in time the same events cause person A to travel back in time that """"already"""" caused person A' to go back in time, i.e. both of their time lines are identical), but in which there is no """"other"""" time line in which the time traveller didn't already appear before travelling back in time (i.e. there is no time line in which person A travels back in time without person A' having travelled in time already, i.e. where person A doesn't eventually become person A', the time traveller).All of this is obviously rendered null and void if the laws of physics are inconsistent and random stuff does appear out of thin air for no reason. ?

In other words, you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way, because you are, work for, or represent, the subject of that article. Your recent contributions may have already been undone for this very reason. To reduce the chances of your contributions being undone, you might like to draft your revised article before submission, and then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. See our help page on userspace drafts for more details. If the page you created has already been deleted from Wikipedia, but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.The one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. It is also worth noting that Wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation. If your username does have such a name, it would be advisable for you to request a change of username.If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the New contributors' help page, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have!

27df761514ec29b3,""" Fred Meyer: Reversion I was asked to explain my reversion of your addition to the Fred Meyer article. That addition was composed of four parts. First, you claimed Fred G. Meyer to be a member of the Rosicrucian Order etc., providing sources. I won't discuss the validity of the sources here, but that clearly concerns Fred G. Meyer himself, not the stores, unless you can provide a source that states his business was influenced by his philosophical leanings. Next, you elaborated on the rosicrucian connection to Hitler. As far as I can see, the main connection to Fred Meyer was that both Nazism and the stores use the colours red, white and black, which is a rather weak link. No source was provided that the store logo may have been influenced by its Founder's rosicrucian connections. Hitler's connection to the rosicrucians was sourced (again I won't discuss the quality of the sources), but was unrelated to the stores. Thirdly, you claimed that the layout of racks gives a swastika and that green freight carts are nicknamed """"U-Boats"""", but this, the part most relevant for the stores, was still unsourced. Finally, the """"Notes"""" part could have been more fitting for the talk page, but definitely does not belong into the article proper.Thus, your additions were either unrelated to the stores or unsourced.

This title, appearing under the symbol of a crown, identifies the huge land as a province under the sovereignty of Norway.  Other maps also show a huge land attached to northern Norway.  On the 14th-century Andreas Walsperger map, the region is called """"Regnii Norwegie"""" (the realm of Norway); maps by Sebastian Munster (1532) and Joachim Von Watt (1534) call the region """"Septentrio;"""" a circular map by Battista Agnese 1543 shows """"Terra Nova"""" extending from Norway to the North Pole.  Maps that portray a huge northern territory reflect the 1261 proclamation of King Haakon IV extending Norse sovereignty over all the lands from Norway to the North Pole.  The """"North Pole"""" he had in mind was the magneticnot the geographic pole.  A 14th-century writer, Philippe de Mezieres, reported that Norway's overseas realm was so extensive that it took three years for the king's tax collectors to complete their rounds and return to Bergen.  One of the territories that Haakon annexed in a 1262 treaty along with Greenland and Iceland was an otherwise obscure place called landanu or """"New Land.""""  The Kongfriget Norges historie (1778) identified an Icelander named Rolf as the discoverer of this New Landalso known as Nyalandin 1258.  It was also identified as part of the North American mainland.  Bishop Gissur Einarsson noted that the direction of sailing to Nyaland from Iceland was southwest.  In that direction lies Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  The region had many names that changed over the years as successive waves of Europeans landed on its shores.  As late as 1347, Icelanders referred to Newfoundland as """"Markland""""which was an ongoing source of lumber.  Sailors from Bristol called the coastal isles """"the Icelands.""""  Circa 1350, a Spanish Franciscan reported an isle called """"Ibernia"""" in the northwest Atlantic that was under Norse sovereignty.  After that date, Bubonic Plague swept through European cities devastating maritime centers.  Norway was particularly hard hitforcing the abandonment of overseas colonies.  English, Portuguese, French, German, and Danish merchants fought over the western isles.  After 1380, Denmark took control of Greenland, Iceland, and mainland in eastern Canada.  The """"new"""" Danish mainland appears on the Claudius Clavus map of 1424 as """"Gronlandia Provincia.""""  Thus, the name """"Norveca"""" was already archaic by the early 15th century when it found its way onto DeVirga's map.  Portuguese maps of the early 16th century feature the names of Joao Fernandes (The Labrador) and the Corte-Real family along the East Coast of North America...""""  ?receding unsigned comment added by 212.113.163.75   Gunnar Thompson has also published on Marco Polo? secret missions to Canada and the ancient Egyptian colonization of Mexico.

I am an MD and FRCPC and I have an obligation to report the use of propaganda by industries that promote unhealthy products. The information I inserted was in two parts. The first part demonstrates why it is clear that both the tobacco industry (previously) and tanning industry promote harmful products and the similarities in their use of marketing and propaganda. The next part clearly outlines """"how propaganda was used by the tanning industry"""".  EXACTLY AS YOU SUGGESTED I MUST DO. UV Radiation is listed as a class I carcinogen by the World Health Organization, so when the indoor tanning industry reports a one-sided argument, and neglects to mention that their product causes cancer, this is propaganda (in keeping with the definition at the top of the article, which I presume you actually read?). When they propose that provincial governments are working with Neutrogena to sell sunscreen to make the public doubt the health care system and their messages regarding the real harms of UV radiation, then this is propaganda.

Also, please keep in mind that due to 1) the Watchtower organization? policy to have JWs shun JWs who conscientiously accept transfusion of blood products it forbids, and 2) your reputation as an ardent supporter of Watchtower policies, then it is expected that JWs who disagree with the Watchtower? blood doctrine would not you access to their choices, and HIPPA regulations are a powerful incentive for clinicians to keep patient preference highly confidential, particularly when it is specifically requested.

For examples, Jennifer Diane Reitz refers to """"transsexuality"""" and Lynn Conway refers to """"transsexualism.""""  If you search """"transsexuality"""" and """"transsexualism"""" on Google, you will find more hits for """"transsexualism.""""  Reality Resources, an ex-trans ministry, frequently uses """"transsexuality,"""" and to me, """"transsexuality"""" sounds like a sexual orientation.  Of course, some people do not like either of these terms.  For example, some people prefer Benjamin's syndrome [], but that definitely sounds like a disease.  Andrea James has proposed the term """"interest in feminization"""" for transsexual women who plan to transition.  She feels like that term would encompass all persons who transition from male to female, or desire to do so, including those who do so for non-traditional reasons.  While I do not feel like the medical community should stop people from transitioning for non-traditional reasons, I also feel like this terminology suggests that transsexualism is a chosen behavior.  I feel that transsexualism is an inborn characteristic, but I don't believe that it should be called a disease.  All said, I feel like Transsexualism is the best title for the Wikipedia article on the subject.

Scorpion, as to your last edit of Dominik about changing 'the line' to the rat, what was meant was that the last line of this episode referes to the symbolisism of the rat in the last scene of the film. I can't edit anything so hopefully you folks can solve this yourself.  And Dominik, per your own hypothetical scenario, if in fifty years from now someone does watch the episode, wouldn't they be confused as to the last moment.

They may or may not have been related: as I explained earlier, the same name is not conclusive evidence of ethnic affiliation.

However, it conflicts with the most natural reading of Tacitus G.46, which is that the VENEDI were between the FENNI and the BASTARNAE and I am using Tacitus as the """"default"""" position in this map. I want to do some more research on this one. But one possible compromise is that we could show them in both places with a ? after the name.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Liberation theology is a phenomenon with an extraordinary number of layers. There is a whole spectrum from radically marxist positions, on the one hand, to the efforts which are being made within the framework of a correct and ecclesial theology, on the other hand, a theology which stresses the responsibility which Christians necessarily hear for the poor and oppressed, such as we see in the documents of the Latin American Bishops' Conference (CELAM) from Medellin to Puebla. In what follows, the concept of liberation theology will be understood in a narrower sense: it will refer only to those theologies which, in one way or another, have embraced the marxist fundamental option. Here too there are many individual differences, which cannot be dealt with in a general discussion of this kind. All I can do is attempt to illuminate certain trends which, notwithstanding the different nuances they exhibit, are widespread and exert a certain influence even where liberation theology in this more restricted sense does not exist.As can be seen he is being quite clear in that only one strand of liberation theology is being condemned.

This would lead to life for the Matabele during his rein prior to and during European intervention, going on to tidy up the somewhat disjointed current description of his fleeing and demise.",0,0,0,0,0,0,

3c0d806c7dd6e1fc,""" Clarification Posted from User talk:IZAK#Meshullam Gross  Hi IZAK, thanks for that neat move of Nachlas Tzvi. Only two issues - one fairly significant.1.If you want to be pedantic, he actually went by the English name of Herman Gross. Meshulam Tzvi was his Hebrew name and used in his Seforim.2.Technically speaking and according to the information availible to me, he was NOT a Rabbi. Apparently (or so I've been told), he was offered Semicha many times and was certainly able, but never accepted it.Therefore, I deliberately refrained from placing him in any Rabbi category, let alone the Haredi category. Off the point since he wasnt a Rabbi, I object to terming him """"Haredi"""" as the boundaries in his age were fluid and the word wasnt even used. Indeed, by todays standards he may not have been """"Haredi"""" (whatever that irksome term means). Many thanks,  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,

3c1f2ca817e03e7e,""" Really tangled paragraph The conception of a right to something that implicitly creates an obligation on someone else to provide that thing (a positive right) is widely challenged.  You can not enforce your wish for something (under the auspices of a right) if it implicitly constitutes an obligation on another to do something for you.  However, one person's right to something creates a negative right in that you have the right for that thing not be interfered with by another, and that other is obligated not to interfere with your right to it.  The obligation test is widely used to determine what constitutes a right.  To illustrate: You have the right to own an axe, but you do not have a right to an axe.  If you do own an axe, others have an obligation not to steal it.I've got a post-graduate education, and I had to read practically every sentence of this paragraph more than once to parse it. And it has a lot of problems beyond that: Normally we avoid second person. I don't see why it is needed here. """"widely challenged"""" with no citation: I have almost never seen this challenged except by liberatarians. I'm pretty confident that most people, for example, consider that the right to life extends to the point of creating an obligation for a government or society to attempt to rescue victims of a natural disaster. I would doubt that there is a """"widely"""" held belief that a person dying of thirst while someone next to him had abundant water could be reasonably expected to die respecting his neighbor's property rights. By the second sentence, this has switched to imperative (or, more precisely, hortatory) mode, which is entirely inappropriate. It becomes a statement of a narrowly libertarian conception of rights, in the article's narrative voice. Again """"widely used"""" without citation. I cannot name a country where this, in general, has the force of law. Certainly not the U.S., one of the more libertarian countries in the industrialized world, but one which recognizes a right to a publicly financed primary and secondary education.In short: poorly written libertarian cant.

3caf9d66065b4fa5,"""Regarding the writer at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hitler_salute    Mr Barlow is a nutter with an obsession. The history of the salute is now improved in the Roman salute article (which had many previous visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page). The pact between the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not well known, and is also not covered widely on Wikipedia, so it is """"covered up"""" by people and also people often refer to it as the """"Nazi-Soviet"""" pact (as the writer above does) which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid Party (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand """"Nazi"""" and the myth that members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party referred to themselves as """"Nazis"""" (they did not refer to themselves as """"Nazis"""").  Some people (note the writer above) try to evade the point with odd comments such as """"It wasn't invented by Wikipedia editors to conceal the word 'socialism'!""""  That comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word """"Nazi"""" to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party: The National Socialist German Workers' Party. Not only is that done in the title of the page cited (the Nazi-Soviet pact page) it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the Party never appears nor even the phrase """"National Socialist."""" The writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand """"Nazi"""" even when discussing the very topic at hand.  The Bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, as noted by Professor Curry. However, as anyone who looks at Dr. Curry's historic photographs of the salute can see, it developed into the same salute as that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Even the writer above concedes Dr. Curry's point that the flag was saluted with a normal military-style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath. The writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the U.S. flag.  It is as if the writer above is conceding the point made. Indeed, the writer seems to concede it with the comment """"Anyway, even if the gesture had been the same, so what? It's just a gesture. The Soviets used conventional salutes, does that mean that the US military are Communists because they use the same gesture as the Soviet military!""""   It is fascinating how the writer again avoids the actual name """"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"""" and also used the term """"Communist"""" instead of using the term """"Socialist.""""  The writer then attempts to avoid the issue, which is the origin of the straight-arm salute, and tries to turn the issue into an odd argument about whether the salutes dictated particular dogmas.  Nevertheless, the writer evades the topic that Professor Curry has raised, which is that Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy were  self-proclaimed National Socialists in the USA three decades before the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and Edward's book was an international bestseller, translated into every major language (including German, which Edward spoke and wrote, and where Edward had studied as a young man) and that Edward's dogma inspired """"Nationalism"""" clubs worldwide including in Germany.     Yes, the """"Roman salute"""" page did once contain innaccuracies, and the writer above is to be thanked for conceding that point. But that is no reason for the writer to start going on with his use of the term """"conspiracy."""" It's just what you get when you have an open encyclopedia! The point is to correct error when you see it, and to not delete those corrections when they are made by people like Dr. Curry.      The writer above also concedes that he is the Wikipedia editor who """"became wiser"""", by incorporating Professor Curry's discoveries.  The writer is to be thanked for crediting Dr. Curry with making it more widely available. It should be noted that the valuable information that Professor Curry provides is his own discovery.  Dr. Curry has also mentioned that the material about the use of the Roman salute in films derives from an academic article by Martin Winkler. Professor Curry pointed out that Martin Winkler did not realize at the time of Winkler's article that the films were all pre-dated by the use of the salute in the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance.  Dr. Curry has also publicly challenged Martin Winkler to debate these issues.  Professor Curry's discovery that the swastika/hakenkreuz, although an ancient symbol, was sometimes used by the National Socialist German Workers' Party as """"S"""" shapes standing for its """"Socialism"""" is also his own original work. And he is right that other writers have deliberately covered up the discovery (as the writer above admits) and have excluded it from the Swa",0,0,0,0,0,0,

Such editors usually end up being indefinately blocked. Actually the vast majority of broadband IP's are never static as far as i'm as i'm aware, so unless you create an actual account to edit with, you will end up with a different IP every different day or week you appear unless it cycles back to one you've already used.Anyways who said i was a loyalist? Never said i was and will state quite clearly for you that i am not one. If i was i'd had no shame in declaring that i am.You show your own lack of knowledge of Irish history anyways. What was James Craig, someone you can call a loyalist, described as at his funeral? As a proud Ulsterman and Irishman. Edward Carson himself was a proud Irishman but can also be easily classified as a loyalist. They always said the Troubles was mostly due to ignorance and prejudice - especially towards history.

3d4f818589755496,"""Hope the picture is clearer: This page (currently) focuses primarily on slave practices in Africa prior to the Islamic and Atlantic slave trades and then with a brief section on how those practices in Africa were transformed by the slave trades.  Connected to this page are Arab slave trade, Atlantic slave trade both of which are pretty good (although I prefer Islamic slave trade).  Less good are African slave trade and Slavery in modern Africa.  The first is an invention, there's no books about the """"African slave trade"""" (Davidson's book of that title is about the """"Atlantic Slave Trade"""") and probably a POV title. This is not to deny an """"indigenous"""" practice or trade in slaves for much of history; but simply that the focus on """"African slave trade"""" is prominent on wikipedia but not in the major books on the topic. Much of its content has long standing tags, some very problematic sources, and POV writing style.  The page could persist but only as a short exploration of the participation of Africans on inland trade of slaves and slave raiding.  The Slavery in modern Africa seems to have a good structure and some good portions, but needs some heft and a title change.  In terms of content overlap, there is some significant content overlap between """"African slave trade"""" with both """"Slavery in Africa"""" and """"Atlantic slave trade"""" (largely because African slave trade is a problematic title and because it analytically wandered).  Most of the other pages refer to each other, but content does not appear to overlap. Idea for reorganization (I'll expand this to more editors, but want to see if anyone has any ideas here first): 1. African slave trade page gets merged into """"Slavery in Africa"""" or other pages as appropriate. 2. Slavery in modern Africa gets changed name to Slavery in contemporary Africa, as more appropriate. 3. Slavery in Africa page largely eludes to slave trades without devoting significant section to the topic, that stays with the slave trade pages themselves. 4. A new article on """"Emancipation movements in Africa"""" or something needs to be created. It is a major topic which is covered as much as the slave trades were ended, but then glossed over entirely by other pages. Any thoughts on this organization?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,

3d5bce9290dacd85,""" Plot: The film opens with Lord Voldemort stealing the Elder wand from Albus Dumbledore's tomb and shooting a large bolt of lightning into the sky. It then cuts to Hogwarts which is no longer a colorful castle of magic, but a shadowy concentration camp surrounded by Dementors with the students being marched through the Entrance Courtyard. Severus Snape stands in the top of the castle and watches the students with a blank expression.At Shell Cottage, Harry Potter sits in front of Dobby's grave, gazing into the one way mirror. He suspects that there is a Horcrux in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts so he, Ron and Hermione strike a deal with Griphook: he will get them into Gringotts Wizarding Bank to find the Horcrux if they give him the Sword of Gryffindor, a bargain to which they reluctantly agree. Harry then questions Ollivander, who examines and identifies the stolen wands of Bellatrix Lestrange and Draco Malfoy. While he confirms that Draco's wand is safe to use, he cautions Harry about Bellatrix's wand, as it is """"unyielding"""" and might be dangerous unless its allegiance has changed. Harry then asks him if he knows about the Deathly Hallows and Ollivander claims he does not think they exist, although Harry knows he told Voldemort about the Elder Wand and is determined to kill Voldemort first.With Harry and Griphook under the Invisibility Cloak, Hermione disguised as Bellatrix and Ron as a foreign wizard with bushy facial hair, the trio and Griphook apparate to Gringotts. During the first phase of the mission Harry and Ron are forced to use the Imperius Curse on Bogrod to cover up Hermione's unsuccessful impersonation of Bellatrix. They manage to get into the vault despite their disguises being removed by The Thief's Downfall, and inside the vault they find Helga Hufflepuff's Cup, the Horcrux, but set off the Geminio curse, causing everything they touch to multiply exponentially. Griphook takes the sword from them after they get the cup, saying that he never said he would help them get out, only in. He runs for it and calls security, the trio are almost crushed by the gold and captured but Hermione gets them to jump on the back of a dragon kept as a security measure. Setting the dragon free, it wreaks havoc killing several goblins (including Bogrod), crashing through the roof and flying off with the trio on its back. After jumping off the dragon into a lake, Harry has a vision of Voldemort furiously killing Griphook and many other Gringotts employees and personnel at Malfoy Manor for allowing his Horcrux to get stolen. Choosing to keep Nagini by his side, he summons his followers and orders them to invade Hogwarts to ensure the Horcrux he hid there is still safe.Having sensed Voldemort thinking of his Horcrux and Hogwarts through their connection, Harry tells the other two they have to go there and destroy it before Voldemort can get to it, and that Voldemort seems to be getting more fragile with each Horcrux destroyed. They apparate to Hogsmeade but immediately trigger alarms set up by Death Eaters, waiting for Harry. The trio are almost captured but Aberforth Dumbledore gets them safely into his home and berates them for coming to the village. Harry discovers that it was him who had been watching them through the mirror shard and him who sent Dobby to rescue them before after seeing the Two-Way mirror hung up on the wall. Aberforth provides them with food and tells them to give up on their mission, go into hiding and save themselves. Harry said that he trusts Dumbledore's judgement that the task has to be seen through no matter what, but Aberforth insists that Albus had left them a suicide mission and it was hopeless. After Harry insisted on finishing what he had started, Aberforth summoned Neville Longbottom through a secret passage behind Ariana's portrait to bring them into Hogwarts. Bruised and beaten by the Death Eaters of the staff, Neville and most of the students have been hiding in the Room of Requirement all year. They welcome Harry in with tremendous applause and jump at the idea of helping Harry finish Voldemort but Harry still doesn't know what the Horcrux looked like or where it was. After saying it might be connected to Ravenclaw, Luna suggests that Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem might be it, despite no one alive today having seen it. Ginny arrives and after gazing at Harry for a moment tells everyone that Snape was now aware of Harry's break in and wanted everyone in the Great Hall.In the hall, Snape orders anyone who may hold information regarding Harry's location to tell him immediately or face punishment. Harry then reveals himself after hiding within the crowd and rebukes Snape for standing where Dumbledore once stood as Headmaster, ordering him to tell the students the truth of how he betrayed and killed Dumbledore as Order Of The Phoenix members enter the Great Hall.

""""Yeah, there are many English speaking countries, but let's just use Britains dialect, for no reason whatsoever!"""", is this what you think goes on in New York? Lol, anyways, did I say that leaving Wikipedia just the way it is results in a less informative encyclopedia? I said no such thing! My argument is that the inherent nature of an encyclopedia is that ALL of the information is based on one standard, so the reader doesn't get confused, and that this inherent nature must be present in Wikipedia as well! It's like trying to subtract X from Z, and expecting a numerical answer, it just doesn't mutually comply, and doesn't work well with an organized, compiled database of informative facts. I agree with you 100% that enhancing your knowledge of dialects is important, but it's just as important as learning how gum is made, learning more about George Washington, and learning what blood is made of, in a relative sense. And this is EXACTLY why there was an article on American/British spelling differences, just as there are articles for chewing gum, George Washington, and blood, and EXACTLY why I chose to raise this issue on that certain articles Talk Page. That's what encyclopedias are for, LEARNING, but learning at your OWN careful and deliberate discretion, not someone elses.Ok, sir, my mistake for not checking my facts, but I just assumed, obviously wrongly, that words like """"pedophile"""" are pronounced the same in both British and American dialects, but only because I've heard British people pronounce pedophile as """"PED-OH-PHILE"""". So, like a normal intelligent person would do, they would make a claim with a reasonable logic base, and not just personal agenda. And you seem to think that I've never heard of that """"ae"""" being merged as one letter, do you seriously take me as a fool? Hope not, beause only a fool and an intellect would raise this issue in the first place, and I am by NO means a fool. Well, I've made mistakes in my past, but so has everybody, right? But in the scholastic sense, I am no fool, at all. Anyways, just incase you AGAIN misread what I wrote, I didn't claim to believe they pronounce it """"PAH-EHD-OH-PHILE"""", I was just giving an example for my statement """"there are words common in both the British and English dialect that in the British dialect aren't spelled as pronounced"""". I assumed, based on my reasonings in the first sentence of this paragraph, that both the British and Americans pronounce this word, and similar words, identically. According to you, I am false on this, but I do not have much faith in your credibility, so I will have to look deeper into this one. ANYWAYS, the reason I even made this argument is that you rebutted my original statement that read somewhere along the lines of """"generally speaking, English words are pronounced as spelled, letter-by-letter"""" with the fact that the word """"color"""" is spelled """"colour"""" in Britain, yet it is pronounced """"CUH-LIHR"""". O.K., we're kind of going in circles here, so lets just concentrate on the main issue(s) here. There are many words that have greek or latin prefixes, yet the word itself isn't related to the meaning of given prefix(es). This is, as far as I know, just coincidence, and unfortunately, partially due to the fact that it's late and I'm tired, I can't think of any examples off the top of my head, but you should know some yourself. Actually, I CAN think of them, but I'm too lazy, and it would be quite redundant, for lack of a better term. So therefore, strictly speaking, """"pedophilia"""" is by NO accounts a word for """"foot fetish"""".You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that's redundant!) as well, but as I've CLEARLY stated, this is not so. I agree with you 110% that no one is """"better"""" than the other, but """"better"""" is very subjective and I'm strictly speaking from an objective point of view. O.K., just so we're on the same page, I'll reword my argument as best I can, for I am pretty tired, so we can stop going in circles:""""Wikipedia is a database of information, and as a database (and also an encyclopedia), there must be a standard setting, language, consolidation, unification, etc., so that the information is clear, proper, and concise.

One is that you really can't tell this story without a little historical context and in particular you can't leave out Morgan and the fruit fly work (and the change in the perception of what mutation was and how it affected the genetic variability of the populstion from the ideas of the earlier Mendalians such as De Vries). So at some point something about it has to go back in. The other is that most modern historians of science (Larson, Bowler, Gould) treat the foundation of population genetics as the start (Gould calls it the first phase) of the modern synthesis, not part of the run up to it. I realize this view differs somewhat from the view of Mayr who emphasizes more the later parts of the synthesis that involved the integration of other fields of biology with population genetics as the actual synthesis, but on this point I think, the article needs to follow the views of most current historians of science rather than those of Mayr or the other participants. There is a reason why historians do not rely exclusively on first person accounts of the participants in an event, and the biggest has to do with perspective.

According to some authors, they were also fleeing forced Islamization by the Turks in what is today Albania (Katsanis, 1994:1). So, some have estimated that, when the Ottomans conquered the whole Greek territory in the XV century, some 45% of it was populated by Albanians (Trudgill, 1975:6). Another wave of Albanian migrations took place during the Ottoman period, mainly in thee XVIII century (Trudgill, 1975:6; Banfi, 1994:19). All these Albanians are the ancestors of modern-day Arbanites in Central and Southern Greece.When the modern Greek state was formed, the Albanian-speaking population and its language were called Albanian .Bickford-Smith, 1993: 47; Embeirikos, 1994; Vakalopoulos, 1994:243-249). However, the policy of the new Greek state was to Hellenize all the non-Greek speaking Orthodox populations within its, then limited, territory as well as in the territories of Epirr, Macedonia, Thrace and Asia Minor still under Ottoman rule). As elsewhere in Europe, army and education were the most effective mechanisms of Hellenization, assisted by the judiciary system ready to denounce and punish all forms of behavior inconsistent with the state? nationalist culture (Kitromilidis, 1990:38; Kollias, 1994).check this:http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Arvanitika or this http://www.traboini.com/al/public_02.html or ARVANITET By Irakli Kocollari Reviewed by Dr. Arben Kallamata If u are Arvanit than translate this,my grandpa used to sing it to me:Moj e bukura Mor?, si t? lash m? s?t? pash?, si t? lash, si t? lash, si t? lash m? s?t? pash?...  rri o laman se sje Arvanit ti po ik e shk?rdheu me gjith Grek!

You may be interested in creating a user account.  Some of the benefits are discussed at this page: Wikipedia:Why_create_an_account%3F  It greatly reduces the chances people will revert your changes, for one thing. -)  Good points, and I've created an account as you suggest. See my notes below as well. sgIn response to the commentary at the very, very bottom of this page (dupe social impacts), I've rearranged the content of the page a bit.  I believe that it now better reflects the chronology of how people are impacted by alcoholism, and therefore reflects the order in which this information becomes important to people: definition, effects, diagnoses, treatment, broader issues.FYI, I renamed the first instance of Social Issues to read """"Societal Issues"""" and moved it into the broader issues area.  I moved the latter one up to become a subheading of the """"Effects"""" category.  After this edit I'm going to go remove the original note of this (because it's no longer germain), so you'll have to look at the next edit in order to read it.  In looking over the article and the discussion of Stanton Peele's perspective et al, I'm wondering whether some of the ongoing discussion held on this page is about a misconception that alcoholism is equal to """"excessive drinking,"""" whatever that is. Alcoholism doesn't refer to someone who drinks a lot. Many people drink a great deal but aren't alcoholic. Conversely, many alcoholics don't drink very much at all compared against the general population's intake.  The section on """"terminology"""" that you removed was intended to address exactly this misunderstanding.  Since you seem to think it's important, I'm putting it back in.  righto Despite the difficulties that we've had of late, the entry is coming together nicely. I'm looking over the EFFECTS section, which has a good deal of information on alcohol itself, and the impact of alcohol USE. It is difficult to tease out the effects of alcoholism versus the effects of alcohol. The effects of alcoholism when an alcoholic is in recovery, for example, would be different from the effects of alcoholism while an individual is drinking on a daily basis. (This is similar, of course, to the situation with other diseases - the effects of diabetes when an individual has well-controlled blood glucoses are different from the effects of untreated diabetes). Nevertheless, I wonder whether the entire section would be more appropriately found in the alcohol article rather than here in the alcoholism article. Can we build a consensus regarding this area?   Alcoholism vs. Alcohol abuse The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism make a difference between one and the other. What I found more confusing is that from """"alcohol abuse"""" you're redirected to """"alcoholism"""".""""Alcoholism, also known as 'alcohol dependence,' is a disease that includes four symptoms: craving, loss of control, physical dependence, and tolerance"""". Moreover, """"Alcohol abuse differs from alcoholism in that it does not include an extremely strong craving for alcohol, loss of control over drinking, or physical dependence"""", etc etc.>> Getting the facts @ NIAAA Response:  Good point.  From one interested perspective, AA literature itself discusses this issue and draws a clear distinction between alcohol abuse and alcoholism. I can't make the correction. I'm not that good informed and my english is quite lousy. Could you..?  How about mentioning something about alcoholism as a form of drug addiction? Correct me if I'm wrong, but alcohol is certainly a hard drug, characterized by intense (and possibly fatal) withdrawals... isn't that addiction?This is mostly true.  The root",0,0,0,0,0,0,

Many thinks the same, I won't deny that. But you have failed to mention that he is who we call as 'Bapak Pembangunan' or 'the Father of Development'. During the reign of Soekarno, whose deed perhaps stopped at the proclamation on August 17th 1945 and the short time following when MPR and DPR are established, Indonesia are on the verge of being turned into a communist nation, and people are on the worst of poverty due to the minimum development and import-export. When Soeharto was the president, Indonesia was at its best of conditionschools are openened everywhere, the 9-year-education program are legitimated, etc. It would be too much to mention all of them. He ruled with military force, correct, but I personally think it was pretty much needed to keep things in order, and would be the right thing to do had not he overdid it.And about Soekarno etc cooperating with Japan, it wasn't completely true. During their time in Indonesia, Japanese banned all national organization and established 'Putera' which aim was to have the educated people of Indonesia to work for Japan. Soekarno, Mohammad Hatta, and few others joined in 'Putera' just so they could gain information about Japanese and have supplies from them. This is also so the Japanese wouldn't keep their eyes on them while they secretly establish the national movement.

3e1d8e74f6f0a2e4,""" Hahaha Check this out:MickMacNee, an editor with a long history of block for disruptive behaviour [10], seems to have gone out of line in the last days. I don't mind him being defensive of an article he has written the major part about, and several users in the AfD discussion have been very much engaged in it, including myself. However, I object to the repated personal attacks and uncivil behaviour by the editor. His history is rather long, so I provide just a few selected diffs of uncivil comment and direct personal attacks during the last days 11, [12], [13], [14]. In the discussion on this page about a third user, he calls my arguments for not agreeing with him """"""""evasion, obfuscation, interuption and intentional deafness"""". That is rather typical of his attitude in the AfD discussion where he agressively drives that everybody disagreeing with him are wrong. I've tried to point it out to him, [15] but with hindsight (given our infected history) it might have been better not to as I should have predicted how he would respond.[16] However, I'm far from alone in having that opinion. In the last days, several other editors have also commented on his behaviour [17], [18], [19], [20].Jeppiz (talk) That block log looks like something out of a Wiki-horror story...why has he not been given long blocks in the past? I would go for a longer-term block. Ks0stm (T??)  A users block log is not (generally) an excuse to throw the book at him, this looks a bit silly if you ask me, a bit of a tit for tat heated discussion over a article for deletion discussion that is split down the middle, and nothing will come of it, I can't find a really uncivil comment, perhaps if you guys just edit different articles for a few days. Off2riorob (talk)  It goes without saying that everybody has different opinions, but I do think that """"one of the nastiest and most repugnant editors"""", """"Either your comment was simply ignorant of the facts (like you characterisation of my POV), or you are simply trolling, either way, you are all out of credit here tbh"""", """"I've got no idea what crappy papers you read"""", """"It's up to you if you want to parrot everybody's delete opinion as if it makes you look like you know what you are on about, but it really doesn't."""" are not particularly civil. Neither is """"I have had it with your crap."""". In any case, I won't interact with the user again, I rather leave Wikipedia. As I pointed out, I'm far from alone in having made these observations.Jeppiz (talk)  Off2riorob, I tried your suggestion, in fact I didn't think I'd need to try, I didn't think I'd cross paths with Mick after this bout of abuse. But sure enough I did, and when I reported him for violation of a 1R measure in place on the Northern Ireland article, half of his defence was an assumption of bad faith against me. I guess if someone keeps an eye on him, he can't get too far out of hand. Alastairward (talk)  It is a bit of a rant, he is clearly very upset about the footie, and I am sorry you have been upset Jeppiz, he has gone now, probably off to bed, I'm sure one of the admins will have a strong word in his ear when he shows his face again. I myself have had a run in with him but he has grown on me, what can I say. Off2riorob (talk)  Seeing the diffs Alastairward provided, I cannot agree, even though I see that you stood up for him that time as well. This is a user who seems unable to deal with conflicting views and routinely resorts to personal abuse.Jeppiz (talk)  Nothing routine about it. Your behaviour and Alistair's are pretty similar, which is why they provoked similar responses eventually. If either of you wish me to lay out the full package of evidence for either of your extraordinarily sustained campaigns of tendentious behaviours, I am only too willing to oblige.

What was the reason for this deletion?68.3.130.42  noviceuserRe: the two flags: on notability, the book has received substantial media attention. See, for example, http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323342404579081503189753492.htmlIn addition, the author himself is critically acclaimed (see his page).On sources, Amazon is a credible source for the topic in question, the relative contents of two books. The Twitter sources are necessary given that 1. Twitter is the topic being discussed (specifically: discussions on Twitter about the book), and 2. the issue is new and has not yet been written about in mainstream publications. These sources can be improved as additional information and media coverage becomes available which is likely given the high profile of the author, the ongoing media attention to the book, and the fact that The Circle will soon be released.68.3.130.42  noviceuserIf it's easily verified, it shouldn't be hard to find secondary sources to support it.   Agreed, that is a fair point, though it will only be easy to do so if sufficient time has passed for secondary sources to pick up on it which they haven't yet. It was only a matter of hours ago that the alleged victim of plagiarism was made aware of the details of the book in question (The Circle) and therefore able to point out the similarities. In the coming days it is likely to receive more attention. The female author in question has upward of 1,500 Twitter followers and a well-received book on Amazon and the other comments on Twitter corroborating her interpretation also come from prominent Tweeters. While I am a Wikipedia novice, it does not seem that this is an unusually suspect story to report in somewhat-real-time versus other pages that are rapidly updated, and to reiterate, it is very obvious from reading the respective Amazon pages that there are myriad similarities between the books and it is only a matter of time before this is picked up.68.3.130.42  noviceuserUpdate: a secondary source is now available. Updating accordingly. 68.3.130.42  noviceuserI see your edit was removed by a bot. I don't think it's impossible that there might surface secondary sources to support this part of the article, but these aren't them. Tweets are generally considered unsuitable, which is why bots remove them. And that Medium post isn't a suitable source either. 1) it's written by the person who is theoretically the aggrieved party in this case, 2) Medium is basically a self-publishing platform, like Livejournal, and doesn't really qualify as a secondary source, especially in the case of a potentially contentious allegation like this.   Let's not let this plagiarism flap stand in the way of making this a better article.  It could use a lot of improvement.  My personal opinion is that the plagiarism claim (which amounts to """"I wrote a book about a woman hired by a social networking firm, and any similar books are plagiarism"""") should not be included in the article anyway, in the absence of a lawsuit or settlement.

When he saw my edits, which he didn't like, he came after me with a vengeance, and lobbied for me to be banned on Wikipedia.  He defamed me on his talk site (yes, I am aware of the meaning of the word, since I also am an attorney).   It was defamation - libel, to be exact -  and removed after a time, when I threatened suit.  I know Wiki doesn't like that - but it reaps what it sows.    THF  threatened me and my husband with frivolous litigation OUTSIDE of Wikipedia, and we called him on it.  We never heard from him again.At that time, Wiki cliques would not or could not listen to what I had to say, and what had occurred.  I have no idea if I am """"banned"""" or not, and don't care at this point.  After the Kafkaesque experience, I never want to edit again here.  That said, I am grateful that you and it appears some others were able to expose him for what he is - even if it took a different issue entirely.

The Python code in the article suffers from two problems:1) It's unclear what kind of value each variable holds.

User:SriSuren keeps talking on trash about the old source and persistently attacking me with nonsensical accusations about my editing but is totally evasive on how this particular text(and with the source, which provides the accurate Tamil translation)is supposedly 'WP:OR' or 'problematic'. Instead he simply rambles on accusing me of 'disruptive' editing, 3 vs 1 etc without explaining what exactly is in the text that needs to be modified. I have gone through his behavior in this talk page as well elsewhere, and I can see he has grossly abused these discussions, absolutely necessitating the need for Administrative action on his behavior, for disgracefully violating the TPGs. Almost all his edits(which have been consistently poised against the Tamil people in general need to be reviewed, and he needs to explain on what overall value he has added to wikipedia in his edits, except for adding/removing sensitive information that fulfills his whims) So perhaps, involvement of more editors to the issue will see through his low-down motives with which he edits, and the barbaric means he resorts to when he gets desperate.

I think that 90% of the people are not interested in their ethnic background, and especially not in their Turkic ethnic background, because they did not rule in the name of Turks, not had they any influence or some other kind of nationalst involvement in the history of the Turkic peoples. Not even Encyclopaedia Britannica (your favourite source) mentions their ethnic background: .  What's important is that the dynasty was started by a former slave, and that it rose out of the chaos that followed Seljuqid decline in Central Asia. It's absolutely unimportant whether Anushtigin was a Turk, a Mongol, a Chinese, or a Brazilian, because his descendants ruled as the """"Shahs of Khorezm"""" and not as the """"Turkic rulers of Turkistan"""". If someone is interested in Anushtigin's background, he can click on the link.

Do you have an objection to this?Lastly, if you find my sources questionable the best way, and the only way in article space, to question them is to find further references which directly contradict or question said references (for instance, a quote by Plato saying, """"Effeminacy has nothing to do with gender, sex, or sexuality,"""" would effectively disable any secondary source to the contrary, or you could find another """"modern"""" """"classicist"""" who describes the errors of my sources). 22:17, 30 Jul 2004 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0,
3f54400007fa50ec,""" Nationality This is a complex subject. Looking at the definition of nationality on the wiki page, it opens with the line """"Nationality is the legal relationship between a person and a state"""", which taken at face value would of course make Nicola Sturgeon's nationality British (just as it is the nationality of Ruth Davidson or Kezia Dugdale), with no possibility of it being Scottish since Scotland does not exist as an independent state, and being born in the UK prior to 1983 conferred British nationality (at least in the legal sense). In previous (rather thinly commented) discussions around SNP politicians, however, the preferred definition has instead been how people see themselves or are assumed to see themselves based on party membership. Is this really a good definition? Particularly given that there is often no actual citation given for these people seeing themselves in terms of actual nationality as Scottish only? When this was discussed in relation to Gerry Adams, the case for his Irish nationality rested on the fact that he has an Irish passport. Obviously in the case of Nicola Sturgeon no such passport exists. What's the real justification for giving her nationality exclusively as Scottish?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,

3f5f7eac12fd519a,""", 24 November 2011 (UTC)My apology if you find a personal attack in my more recent comment above. I have re-read it and can still find none. You """"argue that we should make the definition of polygon consistent with what the lay public is likely to encounter and study"""", while I believe that """"the elementary logic of physical objects is best used in the introductory lead"""". That looks like agreement to me. Where we seem to differ is that you regard this as calling for a Euclidean mathematical definition, while I do not believe that the lay person has sufficient mathematical appreciation for that to be appropriate to the article lead.As to the actual content, the lead grew historically as a result of several contributors thrashing out our differing approaches. What emerged should not be treated lightly, or substantially edited without prior agreement. I am happy to discuss the rest of your  proposal, and no doubt others will chip in to help reach a consensus. I did restore a little of what you wrote, but in the mean time let us not play ping-pong with the page itself.On the matter of references, Regular polytopes and Convex polytopes are widely-read works which can hardly be described as specialised: they are indeed precisely what this lay person encountered and studied. Some others which I referenced are original sources - which, out of respect to you as a professional mathematician, I would not pull away from drawing to your attention. Others do move beyond a Euclidean treatment, and were there simply to make the point which begins the subsequent paragraph.More directly relevant is the issue that most lay people would regard a pentagram as a """"star polygon"""", recognised as such since the days of Archimedes but excluded by the definition you gave, which is more formally understood as a """"simple polygon"""". While mathematicians such as Gr?nbaum and yourself might choose to frequently omit descriptors such as """"simple"""" or """"convex"""" in treatments of these objects (Gr?nbaum explicitly, yourself implicitly), a general introduction to the subject can take no such luxury. The article lead should conform as far as is possible to the lay person's preconceptions, whereby polygons may be divided into those which self-intersect and those which do not.With that proviso, if you have ideas for significant changes to the article lead, I would hope you can share them with us  first. ?Cheers,  (Talk) 20:34""",0,0,0,0,0,0,

While I've seen Malleus' behavior over time neglect basic civility, it was incorrect for me to assume that it's always been that way.No, the statement was not a personal attack.  The reactions alleging that I've been attempting to """"unperson"""" Malleus are hyperbolic and simply not true.  Malleus does not conform to the fourth pillar.  One must conform to all five pillars to be a Wikipedian; that is the social conract.  While my earlier thoughts had been running along the lines of one must endorse all the pillars, that puts an emphasis on belief rather than conduct. One can be banned after making many valuable contributions to Wikipedia.  The various persons who are banned: Jack Merridew/Bre'r Rabbit/Gold Hat/etc. is not an unperson.  Betacommand is not an unperson.  Will Beback is not an unperson.  I would argue that my statement could be equally applied to any of them or other banned users for a similar reason: each of them failed to uphold the fourth pillar, although in a variety of ways and intensities, and was banned for that.  Malleus has the distinction of being the most prolific content creator being up for a ban in my memory.  The content he has created has is not in question, and he has had an admirable pattern of contribution to the encyclopedia... but that's not sufficient.  Much like Betacommand, Malleus has been shown repeatedly that his style of interaction is insufficient, and he has chosen to continue it. No one has proposed that Malleus' contributions be erased, that his name be stricken from anywhere or anything.

I haven't examined the growth, but yes, gradual growth (as opposed to sudden jumps in size) suggests that the editorial work went on here. So perhaps I was too hasty.Here is Graham's page about himself. I now notice that it says at its foot Excerpt from Gallery Press Release, 2008. So it's possible that it copied the press release which itself was a copy of the WP article.So maybe I have an """"overly critical attitude"""". But if so, it's an overly critical attitude toward the editing, not Graham's work. (I've seen some of his early work from Beyond Caring and think it's very good; I know little about his other work.)Why the apparent concentration on Japan? First, it's hardly a concentration; it's simply the addition of a sourced fact. And, if you're interested, here's how it came about. Having created Category:Photography in Japan, I populated it. Racking my brain for non-Japanese photographers who'd done a significant amount of work in Japan was a pleasant activity for a commuter trip or three; I also emailed a couple of friends more knowledgable about the matter than I am. Graham's name came up, either to one of them or to me. I was certain that he'd done work in Japan so I put this in  in accordance with WP policy, backing up the assertion with a reliable source. This was a contribution of time and energy, though admittedly a tiny one. Graham's work seems to have many admirers. I was hoping and expecting that among themselves they'd rebuild the article. I'd be willing to help with this. While not working on Graham's article, I've been working on articles about other photographers.So let's turn back the clock to September 2008, before the cuts. Here's a paragraph:Graham was the first photographer to combine the sensibility of contemporary colour photography with classic British social documentary. In 1981/2 he made A1?he Great North Road, a book of 40 colour photographs taken along the length of the British A1 road, which had a transformative effect on the black and white tradition that had dominated British art photography till that point. This work, along with Graham's later photographs of the 1980s -  the colour images of unemployment offices in Beyond Caring (1984-85), and the sectarian marked landscape of Northern Ireland Troubled Land (1984-86) - were pivotal in reinvigorating and expanding this area of photography, by both broadening it's visual language, and questioning our notions of what such photography could say, be, or look like. Photographers like Martin Parr made the switch to colour soon after, and a new school of British Photography evolved with the subsequent colour work of Richard Billingham, Tom Wood, Paul Seawright, Anna Fox, Nick Waplington, etc.Let's suppose for a minute that this is legitimate WP text, and not ripped off from somewhere else. Its content is a mixture of the easily verifiable and  the arguable. Was he the first photographer to make this combination? Did this one book have a transformative effect? Why """"British art photography"""" (my emphasis)? How were they """"pivotal""""? This stuff would have to be sourced. (Yes, writing for WP is a bitch.)Backing for some and perhaps even all of this is probably within Williams' text for How We Are and Mellor's for No Such Thing as Society. Do you have either of these?    """,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Thank you. ProtestWhy did you take my vote?Why did you cross """"delete"""" two times?This way you censored my vote not once, but twice !I will complain to other admin's for your clearly illegal behaviour!  Context Note: The discussion here refers to the user's comments at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bosniakophobia. He had posted a bolded """"Do not delete"""" on three separate occasions, and I struck two of them out for the sake of clarity when the AfD was going to be closed. He still has one of his three """"votes"""" (inasmuch as they are in fact votes), which is as many as everyone else involved. The """"more detailed explanation"""" to which he refers isn't in fact present, as it is in fact roughly 50% of a longer explanation that he had already posted. Again, in the interests of clarity, I struck this out.  - Schreit mich an  Okay Concerning your comments on my TalkPage, now that you gave enought explanation, fair enough.Although I wish you somehow merged all comments together instead of crossing them, but anyways. I see that Serbs are winning against nomination of Bosniakophobia as an article @ Wikipedia. What Serbs did BigHaz, and you need to understand this from factual and fair view of perspective, they (Serbs) invented word """"Serbophobia"""", then nominated her on Wikipedia, and other Serbs came and voted """"YES! Keep it!"""" and now thousands of """"wikipedia scrapper pages"""" are basicly spreading this word as a cancer over the internet. So, let's delete both Bosniakophobia and Serbophobia, because NONE of these words is in English dictionary ! So why keep Serbophobia? Why? Please tell me your reasoning. Please! Thanks.  I would have merged the comments if there'd been anything to merge. As it was, one comment was a duplicate of the other, which meant that there was precisely nothing which could gainfully have been merged. In terms of Serbophobia, you'll note that I have not expressed any opinion at all in that AfD (even I have my limits when it comes to the murky world of Balkan ethnic politics). However, I will investigate the matter further, since you've asked.  - Schreit mich an Contextual Postscript: Having looked into the murky world of Balkan ethnic politics slightly further in the interests of making sure that I wasn't shooting off my mouth about something that multiple people were doing, I noticed at the Serbophobia AfD that the above user had in fact done much the same thing that he'd done at the Bosniakophobia discussion - although with the opposite intention. I repeated the process of striking the duplicate """"delete"""" votes. One of the delete votes had a relatively long and potentially important rationale attached, so I didn't strike it. Of course, anything that's struck out is still patently visible to a closing admin or contributing user, and more legible via the editing screen if legibility is a problem. One of these days I'm going to have to make good my promise to myself of learning Serbo-Croatian.  - Schreit mich an Lakes UnitedI have added information to the article in an effort to establish notability. I would be grateful if you could take a look.  Done and done - complete with my position altering. Not being a Rugby League fan of any note, I'd taken the assumption that what looked like a local team in its initial incarnation as an article probably was.

On Thursday 21st April 2011, upon the residents of the area witnessing the attack, in which seven vandals caused costly damage to the structure and it's fences as well as many surrounding trees, a cardboard banner was attached to the fence reading """"Under orders of Gwern"""".This is not the only occasion in which your Wikipedia account has been referenced.

The initial aim failed, they never were able to reach the roof; however, their banner was slung over a nearby house for all to see.Also, on 12th December 2010, a middle-aged man was seen sprinting away from elderly people with several teenagers following and aiding him.

At the very top it states:""""It is also used to categorize a number of diverse populations together based on historical and prehistorical ancestral relationships. Some definitions of the term include only people of relatively recent Sub Saharan African descent (see African diaspora). Among the members of this group, dark skin is most often accompanied by the expression of natural afro-hair texture (although a recent scientific study notes that human skin color diversity is highest in sub-Saharan African populations). Other definitions of the term """"black people"""" extend to other populations characterized by dark skin, including some indigenous to Oceania and Southeast Asia""""This article even mentions Oceanians and Southeast Asians (such as the Great Andamanese, Native Fijians, the Ati,  and the Melanesians) even though these groups genetically have more in common with neighboring Asian populations and are very distant from other people who are considered Black Africans. Ethiopians are black Africans. Some of them have Middle-Eastern ancestry (Ethiopia is a short boat ride from Arabia), but that automatically does not make them an entirely mixed population; nor does it change the fact that their roots are mainly in Africa. Sicilians have some Middle-Eastern ancestry, but they are still considered European. Ancient Romans certainly referred to Ethiopians as black. They used the term """"Ethiopian"""" to describe all Black Africans they came across, regardless of their location outside of East Africa (read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_expeditions_to_Sub-Saharan_Africa)I went to the Beta Israel page and found two very clear references: Ephraim Isaac (1974), The Falasha: Black Jews of Ethiopia.

It's 5.45 pm and I waitat my friend's office on Queen Street in downtown Toronto. Afterwaiting a while, my friend tells me: ``I don't know if she's gonnacome in her male persona or her female one. ``Ummm hmmm, I reply.I'm mildly curious about meeting a Drag Queen myself, having thus faronly seen them on the subway or in downtown clubs.I try recollecting what little I knew about Enza. Her real name: EnzoAnderson. In 2000, she ran for mayor of Toronto, Ontario. Althoughthe eventual winner of that campaign, Mel Lastman, won over 80 percent of the vote, Anderson surprised many by garnering 15,000 votes,placing third! She was one of the few candidates (besides Lastman,Ben Kerr and Tooker Gomberg) to get any kind of recognition in therace, even though all she did was stand on downtown street cornerswith a handmade placard that read: """"Vote for me - I have the bestlegs in town.""""Having changed her name to """"Enza Supermodel"""", Anderson (whose senseof irony, I learn later, is razor-sharp), runs in political raceswhere the major candidate has no serious challenger on the ballot.At 6.15, fashionably late, she walks in, six feet, three inches tall,in her beautiful black pointy stilettos; she's wearing a short blackdress, showing off great legs, light black stockings and a chic blackleather jacket. And the first thing I think is - Oh. My. God.She is beautiful. That particular day I'm wearing scruffy blue jeanscut-off at the knees, running shoes and a T-shirt I grabbed from mycloset two minutes before I ran out the door. Some lipstick, a dashof mascara and I was ready in seconds. Now, looking at her, I feelless like a woman than I've ever felt in my entire life. I never wasone of those `la de da' women, mind you, but right now, I wish I was.I feel insecure, ugly and yes, jealous.We get into a taxi and Enza graciously lets me sit in the front seat.I feel a bit awkward. I don't know where to start, so I stare out thewindow. I look back politely and smile now and then as Enza talks tomy friend. Suddenly she says, """"Oh, lovely nails!"""" and I jump. Er ah,my nails? But she is charming about it.After that, we settle down to some nice comfortable girl talk and Iask her the question I've been dying to ask. """"How long does it takeyou to do your make-up, Enza?"""" and she replies, """"Three hours."""" Afterall, she has to do her legs, her arms, her face, her body. She'shappy to give me the most minute (and unnecessary) details of how shewanted a breast job but decided to just wear padded bras instead.That evening, the TV show meeting turns out to be a disaster. Thethree men in the room (all heterosexuals, they assure each other)can't take their eyes of Enza's legs. I get a lot of amusementwatching how their eyes slide down her legs and desperately make anattempt to meet yours if you address them. She is charming and funny.She tells the crowd how she got her name, """"Ya know, gurrl friend,what else would I be, but a Supah model?"""" and how she works in a barduring the day and takes photographs of celebrities by night.I must admit I'm fascinated. Enza studied to be an engineer and laterbegan dressing up in drag, partly to party, and partly because that'sher version of Show Biz.""""Honey, I put on a good show, I got more shoes and dresses thanImelda Marcos!"""" I believe that.I go home that evening, feeling a little strange inside my head. It'sthe first time I've felt special to be born a woman.

Since Colby is mentioned numerous times in DeCamp's book, and appears directly in the Conspiracy of Silence documentary, it seems safe to say that he agrees with this.How much stronger does testimony get? The guy was the former director of the CIA for god's sake. Add to this the fact that he was very likely murdered when you review the details of his death, and it seems likely that this guy was considered a threat to SOMEONE. Whether he was killed because of this particular case remains to be proven, but it's all far too suggestive for me. If it were just DeCamp ranting and raving about a massive ring of sadistic pedophiles within the government, I'd find it all much less convincing. But Colby's apparent agreement with his thesis is quite chilling to me.I don't necessarily think this should change its """"hoax"""" status within Wikipedia, but I'm curious what the true skeptics (a camp I'd like to be able to join), think about this particular detail.

This seemed reasonable as the idea of a stub tag, as opposed to regular categories is not to categorise people, but to group them for interested editors, so if all we know about someone is that they played English football, that is the obvious place to stub-sort them. I certainly don't have a problem with the alternate wording you mention, although I notice it has been reverted for consistency on one of the pages linked.

To answer your question:We require multiple sources so that we can write a reasonably balanced article that complies with Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, rather than representing only one author's point of view.

It is common for multiple newspapers or journals to publish the same story, sometimes with minor alterations or different headlines, but one story does not constitute multiple works. Several journals simultaneously publishing different articles does not always constitute multiple works, especially when the authors are relying on the same sources, and merely restating the same information. Similarly, a series of publications by the same author or in the same periodical is normally counted as one source. (WP:GNG, footnote 3)I appreciate your work. Truly I do.

They signed with Simon Cowell's record label Syco Records after forming and finishing third in the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor in 2010. Propelled to international success by social media, One Direction's four albums, Up All Night (2011), Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013) and Four (2014) broke records, topped charts in most major markets, and generated hit singles including """"What Makes You Beautiful"""", """"Live While We're Young"""", """"Story of My Life"""" and """"Steal My Girl"""".Their achievements include five Brit Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, eleven MTV Europe Music Awards, and nineteen Teen Choice Awards out of nineteen nominations, among many others.

They were proclaimed 2012's """"Top New Artist"""" by Billboard. According to the Sunday Times Rich List, by April 2013, they had an estimated personal combined wealth of ?25?illion ($41.2m) making them the second-wealthiest musicians in the UK under 30 years of age.

The """"bible"""" for chemists on group theory is still """"Chemical applications of Group Theory"""" by F. Albert Cotton, even though my edition (the 1st) is now 60 years old. I agree that """"a steer on how irreps are used in chemistry  symmetrised basis sets, etc  and their overall significance might be useful"""", but I really find it hard to see how it would fit in with what is already there. Then I suspect that, if I did spent a lot of time doing it, it would be deleted on the grounds that I was oversimplifying or just plain wrong. I am not really sure I can help, and I am rather busy at present.   (Discussion) """,0,0,0,0,0,0,

MarkhamFounded TABApril 3, 1915(as the Palmdale Post)Headquarters TAB37404 Sierra HighwayPalmdale, California 93550 United StatesCirculation TAB21,675 (2010)Official website TABavpress.comThe Antelope Valley Press, colloquially referred to as the Valley Press or AV Press by its staff and Antelope Valley residents, is a daily newspaper with emphasis on local news located in Palmdale, California USA. It is the largest circulating newspaper in the area. The Valley Press covers the fast growing Antelope Valley - especially the Palmdale/Lancaster Urbanized Area (a US Census Bureau defined term) and adjacent areas of north Los Angeles and southeastern Kern counties, including the upscale Los Angeles urban escapes of Acton and Agua Dulce. The newspaper is conservative in its political stance.Other adjacent areas the Valley Press covers on an as-needed basis include the Victor Valley, Bakersfield and the southern San Joaquin Valley, and the Greater Los Angeles Area. This is especially true for aerospace related stories and local high school and college level sports.Contents    1 History    2 Technology and editorial outlook    3 References    4 External linksHistoryThe Valley Press was founded by A.J. Hicks on Saturday, April 3, 1915 as the Palmdale Post. At the time, the Valley was home to about 3,500 people. Over the decades of the 20th century, the newspaper changed hands, and there were a few name changes as well. On May 4, 1950, the paper became known as the South Antelope Valley Press.On July 1, 1958, four men initiated a partnership between the Markham and Odett families. Arthur F. Folz was president of the board of directors in 1958, with Ralph and his brother Maurice W. Markham as vice presidents and Lamont Odett Sr. as secretary-treasurer. Ralph H. Markham bought out Maurice W. Markham, and Lamont Odett Sr. bought out Arthur F. Folz on April 1, 1961, to create the partnership of Ralph H. Markham and Lamont Odett Sr. In October 1975, Lamont Odett Sr. died and sons Bill and Monty Odett Jr. became co-publishers. On March 1, 1981, William C. Markham joined the Odetts in daily management of the paper and was elected corporate vice president and advertising director. William C. Markham became president of the board of directors after Ralph H. Markham's death in November 1985.The Markham family became sole owners of the Antelope Valley Press in January 1994. William C. Markham is president and publisher. The William Odett family had father William and his son Lamont (""""Monty"""") Odett Sr. running the day to day operations of The Yuma Morning Sun (Now The Yuma Sun) with William's new wife Miriam as part of the team in the circa 1925 to 1935 period in Yuma, Arizona. When the Morning Sun changed ownership in 1935, the Odetts moved to the San Fernando Valley and later to Palmdale.The paper later dropped the """"South"""" from its nameplate, and became simply the Antelope Valley Press by the early 1960s. It was a Thursday afternoon weekly until 1959 when a Sunday edition debuted. The Tuesday edition was added in 1969, followed by Friday (1982) and Wednesday (1988), Saturday (1992) and finally the Monday edition in 1998, making the Antelope Valley Press a full-fledged daily newspaper - perhaps the first Mojave Desert California based newspaper to commence daily publishing with morning delivery. The paper remains in family hands, and has never been corporately owned or had nonlocal ownership.Technology and editorial outlookThe Valley Press was famed locally from the late 1950s for its peach-colored newsprint while under the Odett/Markham family ownership. The paper stopped using peach newsprint in 1975 due to expense and the increased use of color.The newspaper moved into the digital age beginning in 1986 when City Editor Bill MacKenzie was given the assignment to find a publishing system. The result of that search was the installation of a Morris Publishing System network of personal computers for both classified and editorial requirements. That classified system was replaced in 1999 with Digital Technology Internal equipment. Editorial followed in 2002 to make the paper completely paginated in one system. The classified system was upgraded in early 2005 and the editorial system will be upgraded by year's end.A Valley Press legacy to the motorists of the Antelope Valley, as w",0,0,0,0,0,0,

McNeil, page 3:They went to live with her parents in Visegrad on the banks of the Drina, where young Ivo grew up in an artisan family (his grandfather was a carpenter) playing on the bridge he was later to make so famous, ..., The family was Orthodox Christian, i.e. Serb;and in theThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1961 Presentation Speech by Anders sterling, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy - As a young Serbian student, he joined the national revolutionary movement, suffered persecution, and was imprisoned in 1914 when the war broke out. which shall have place in his biography for knowing that the book translator Edwards and the world-renown historian McNeil were close Ivo's friends. Both biographical notes were written in the first edition of this Ivo's book in 1959 and the biographical data are coming from the very Ivo.Anders sterling's Presentation Speech during the official ceremony 1961 in Sweden and in the Andric's presence - gives the undeniable credibility to biographical data heard in this speech. - As to the Clasification paragraph - it has nothing to do with biography - just a slander and disrespect of this great writer. My proposal - delete it completely. From the above discussion - is visible that Andric rejected idea to be seen as of Croatian lineageWhen Krleza attempted to allign Ivo with Croats - Ivo responded this way Enes Cengic; """"Krleza post mortem"""",  I-III.

Ionako  je bilo iznad moje moci da tu ista  diram i ispravljam. Mjesec ili ne znam koliko nakon sto mi je poslao tekst, primim od Milana pismo  u kojem mi kaze da je kopiju teksta dao Ivi Andricu na uvid te da on moli da budem ljubazan i da u  tekstu nesto izmijenim, a to je: Ivo Andric, rodjen u Travniku 10.10.1892. godine, hrvatskog porijekla, zavrsio skole itd.... Moli  me da brisem da je hrvatskog porijekla. Na to odgovaram Bogdanovicu (oprostite sto citiram):      Dragi moj Milane, Pozdravi Ivu Andrica u moje ime, veoma srdacno,i poruci mu, ako mozes, da mu ja jebem hrvatsku majku, brisat cu da je hrvatskog  porijekla.""""

Because it's vague when you say just rock history, it would be fitting for Yoshiki to be the an influential drummer (maybe most, but that might need a citation as well) in rock history in Asia.  So, when we say that Bonham is one of the most influentials drummers in the rock history, we have to say that his one of the most influentials drummers in UK and not in the rock history? =/, yeah, Yoshiki is the mots influential drummer of Asia, but Asia is also inside the rock history don't forget this ;) Only Japan? Somebody has just put that Yoshiki is one of the most influential drummers in Japan rock history, eehm, everybody knows that Yoshiki is THE drummer of Japan, and because of that is one of the most influentials in all rock history, not only in the rock history of Japan, if you see bands in China, Korea, et.c you'll see that their drummers are fans of Yoshiki.Well, I guess not just Japan but in Asia. The reason to why I put that is because while Yoshiki is well-known in parts of Asia, he wasn't as influential in many countries like the Americas, Africa, and Europe.

If this article needs any attention or maintenance, it would be preferable if that could be done before its appearance on the Main Page. The blurb as it stands now is below:Henry Cornelius Burnett (1825?866) was a U.S. Representative from the state of Kentucky and a Confederate Stattates Senator. He represented Kentucky's 1st congressional district during the lead-up to the Civil War. This district contained the entire Jackson Purchase region of the state, which was more sympathetic to the Confederate cause than any other area of Kentucky. Burnett promised the voters of his district that he would have President Abraham Lincoln arraigned for treason. Besides championing the Southern cause in Congress, Burnett also worked within Kentucky to bolster the state's support of the Confederacy. He presided over a sovereignty convention in Russellville in 1861 that formed a Confederate government for the state. The delegates to this convention chose Burnett to travel to Richmond, Virginia to secure Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy. Burnett also raised a Confederate regiment at Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and briefly served in the Confederate States Army. Burnett's actions were deemed treasonable by his colleagues in Congress, and he was expelled from the House in 1861. After the war, he was indicted for treason, but was never tried. He returned to the practice of law, but died of cholera in 1866 at the age of 40. (more...)  == A ba",0,0,0,0,0,0,

This makes the word's use completely inappropriate in relation to the Dunmanway massacre as none of those killed had any loyalty to the IRA.

41b250e3f8c9fa82,"""WhoMe's new introductionAfter the last few days many of us from both sides of the fence had worked out an informative introduction that was both clear and covered the main points. Most importantly it described the view of the official body for naming astronomical nomenclature and combined both their working definition for extrasolar planets and their more recent definition for out own solar system in a clear fashion to inform people in the opening paragraph. The new intro is junk. Please can we amend this without having an edit war.  Having looked at the lastest changes/reverts/whatever made by yourself, I find the recent changes to be much clearer than when I originally started discussing this controversy.  Despite many objections on both sides, the article is much clearer.  I'm assuming here that what is currently is what you want the article to look like.  I certainly won't start an edit war over it! I've never participated in an edit war and I don't intend to start now. ? (comment)  Actually, I would have preferred just listing """"A planet is officially defined as..."""" but now it has been amended so:a) there are links a the naming dispute both in the first sentence as well as the sandboxb) it is not listed as the official definition, just as a definition by the IAUc) it is noted that this is recent and also that there were alternate lists before thisd) there is link to the astrology article that defines planet differentlye) there is a quantifier to say it may not be universally accepted.I think not to address the IAU definition in the introduction is more POV than including it, giving its significance. We have already given it far less credit than all reports in the mainstream and scientific media.  Well at least one entry (d) does not need to be there.  I added it to the disambiguation page, so that should be sufficient.  There is no need to list it on this page explicitly. ? (comment)  I felt that seeing that the astrology term described many of the same objects as the astronomy term there should be a direct link, especially given the dispute over Pluto, which, as you rightly pointed out, will still be counted by many astronomers. However, if you still feel it should be taken out I won't object. And for the record, despite the initial clash of heads I've enjoyed working with you on this and you have persuaded me to be a lot closer to your view. Thanks.  I'm not terribly concerned about the astrology link, one way or another.  It isn't intrusive.  As for this discussion, I really havn't even been editing the article or really following the changes as closely as others have been.  This discussion is so time consuming!  When I first ran accross the article I was deeply concerned with the slant, but there has been a lot of work.  I still have issues with using the word """"official"""", since only 424 persons out of 2,411 (approximately 18%) who attended the IAU assembly even voted on the issue and there are enough published articles showing the controversy that the vote has caused.  With that said, the introductory paragraph does a good job at mentioning the lack of a historical scientific agreement for the definition of planet.  This balance may be sufficient to show all sides on this debate.  I might like it if it was the """"official scientific body"""", because surely there are no other organizations that can make that claim and it still leaves room for """"unofficial cultural definitions"""", such as those widely used by the general public. Ironically, I think the article may now focus a little too much attention on the naming controversy.  I would put """"Definition"""" and """"Disagreement"""" under the main heading of """"Etymology"""".  I think it would flow better and put less emphasis on the controversy.  Afterall, the definition of the word is what Etymology is all about, and the controversy occurred chronologically after the information currently under the heading of Etymology. ?

41b2d9b74acff390,"""Administrator, I regret to inform you that from where I stand you sound like you have taken sides. In my eyes it undermines your position as an impartial arbiter and reflects upon your reputation. Overall in my view your handling of the matter has been so far lacklustre at best. You practically admitted that your decision to block me was made on impulse (you initially put a wrong reason as grounds for the block). It seems you are concentrated on watching me while turning a blind eye on how I am being treated. When one of the accusers calls me an 'unfortunate fella' and you choose to ignore it, am I correct to assume that I can also call my opponents 'unfortunate fellas' or you as a watchdog will block me for another 'personal attack'?  I think your last remark is absolutely unwarranted. """"Please stop telling people not to post here""""? I was not telling I was asking and very politely for that matter, as I do not want my talk page to be turned into an incoherent pile rather than than what Wikipedia creators intended it to be. I think your popping up like that and commenting a minor post of mine looks like another impulsive decision unworthy or an administrator, and also comes dangerously close to what may be interpreted as open bias and prejudice. I kindly ask to get off my back - you really need not be there, I am not such a loose cannon that scrutiny of every little post of mine would be justified. I perceive such excessively close 'guidance' as pressure, and I will act accordingly if I feel your actions contradict your status of an administrator.

After all, James is a political and religious figure infitessimally more important to analyze or discuss in much less personal terms than having to do with sexuality or other habits.  After all, James wrote a treatise on smoking as repellant, but this is not so big a deal because of its lack in uniqueness or value in comparison to his policies.  Most gay Wikiproject participants admittedly find James a guilty hypocrite for all done in his name by fundamentalists, against gays.  This is essentially the problem.

Instead, it depicted itself as a citizens group merely interested in American ideals of freedom.

Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that they  userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia.

When the government attempted to close it down and prosecute the operators for counterfeiting, the prosecution was defeated by the detail that the dollar coins were fractionally overweight.  The street price of silver in Carson City was low enough to still permit a profit on the minting. Thus, unable to prevent the minting of silver coins in Carson City, the Treasury took over operations and pocketed the fractional overweight.  Even if this story is inaccurate, I believe the story ought to be included, perhaps with its disproof, but it does shed light on the issue of the discrepancy between the value of silver as a commodity and as currency.",0,0,0,0,0,0,

43177075d7007aee,"""Allstarecho is correct in what he says. There is no reference to male-male sexual relationships in the section: Personal relationships. Here is what it currently says, in it's entirety: James's personal relationships included relationships with his male courtiers and his marriage to Anne of Denmark, with whom he fathered his children. Growing up, James did not have any parents, for his father, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, was murdered and his mother, Mary I of Scotland was forced to flee when she married the suspected murderer, James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell. His grandfather was assassinated during his boyhood, and he had no siblings.[103][104]Someone reading the article as it is now would have no idea that there is any debate about James's sexuality. The word """"relationships"""" could mean anything, depending. I also agree with Carcharoth that the current concepts of gay and homosexual are quite different from Jacobean England's, as are concepts of male bonding, friendship, and what's acceptable in society across most cultures and time periods. However, there are reliable sources that say James had sexual relationships with at least some of his male associates. Call it what you will, but excising that from the main article section is not fair. Don't use modern terms if that is the issue. Also, the section should be in rough proportion to the other summary sections in this article, and several of them are approx 230 to 330 words long. Footnote #24 is 117 words. I would agree to move the footnote up to that section and integrate it, including the assertion that it is murky, and debated.  Even if that section is shorter, as long as it gives readers the idea that there is debate about James's sexuality. Then work on the daughter article per the suggestion. That seems fair and balanced, something that I wish to work toward. But to excise mention of anything other than platonic/family relations from the main article is not. Sorry, but footnotes don't count. People just don't generally read them. ?  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,

432b5e906ee1c546,"""I didn't write the sentence about the biblical references, I merely supplied them. I don't remember who  wrote the sentence.  However, a federal circuit court, wrote, (one of my deleted references):The following was excerpted from Iannaccone v. Law, 142 F.3d 553 (2d Cir. 1998):The right to proceed pro se in civil actions in federal courts is guaranteed by 28 U.S.C. ? 1654, which provides: """"In all courts of the United States the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel as, by the rules of such courts, respectively, are permitted to manage and conduct causes therein."""" Section 1654's guarantee derives directly from the Judiciary Act of 1789.First introduced in the Senate on June 12, 1789 as part of Senate Bill [S-1], the right to self-representation appeared in section 31 of the Bill. But when the Bill became law, on September 24, 1789, the right was moved to section 35, which reads as follows: """"That in all the Courts of the United States the Parties may plead and manage their own causes personally or by the assistance of such Counsel or Attornies at law as by the rules of the said Courts respectively shall be permitted to manage and conduct causes therein."""" V Documentary History of the First Federal Congress of the United States of America 1789-1791 1150, 1165, 1193 (1986). As can be seen, the right to self-representation has remained constant for over 200 years.The framers of our Constitution thought self-representation in civil suits was a basic right that belongs to a free people. Although the Supreme Court alluded to civil pro se representation in Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 812-13 (1975), the Court there focused its discussion on the right to represent oneself as a defendant in a criminal case, id. at 813 et seq., which the Constitution's Bill of Rights guarantees.In a criminal prosecution, a pro se party of course may only appear as a defendant. In a civil case, a person may appear pro se as either a plaintiff or defendant. And, as noted, the right of self-representation in one case is protected by the Constitution, and in the other, simply by statute. Further, in contrast to criminal defendants, civil litigants unable to afford counsel cannot ordinarily obtain appointment of counsel, except in circumstances when there is a risk of loss of liberty, as in mental commitment or juvenile delinquency proceedings. See H.B. Kim,Legal Education For the Pro Se Litigant: A Step Towards a Meaningful Right to Be Heard, 96 Yale L. J. 1641, 1646-47 (1987).Moreover, the historical origins of self-representation in civil and criminal proceedings are different. In Faretta, the Court discussed the historic requirement of having counsel, going back to the infamous English Star Chamber that forced counsel upon an unwilling defendant in a criminal proceeding, and the requirement's gradual reform. This reform was fervently embraced in colonial America for those accused of crime. See Faretta, 422 U.S. at 821-26.Passing from the criminal to the civil context, we . . . observ[e] that a person appearing pro se in federal court can be a mixed blessing because persons appearing pro se lack legal training and may, on occasion, burden the court by filing illogical or incomprehensible pleadings, affidavits and briefs. And sometimes a pro se litigant appears simply for the purpose of using the courtroom to advance a political or social agenda, or to pursue a matter that is legally unredressable. See E.J.R. Nichols, Preserving Pro Se Representation in an Age of Rule 11 Sanctions, 67 Tex. L. Rev. 351, 351 nn.2 & 3 (1988). Yet, even given those potential burdens, there still remains a citizen's right of access to the courts, a strongly held notion stretching back to the beginnings of our Republic. The origins of the right to appear for oneself in civil proceedings derive from a number of sources, all deeply rooted in our history and culture. We undertake to discuss briefly five of those sources, though doubtless there are others:First, history. Under the English common law with its complicated forms of action and veritable maze of writs and confusing procedures, the right to retain counsel in civil proceedings became a necessity. By the middle of the thirteenth century, lawyers so monopolized the courts in London that the King was forced to decree that, except for a few special causes, litigants were entitled to plead their own cases without lawyers. See The Right to Counsel in Civil Litigation, 66 Colum. L. Rev. 1322, 1325 (1966).Second, mistrust of lawyers made appearance in court without benefit of counsel the preferred course. See A.L. Downey, Note, Fools and Their Ethics: The Professional Responsibility of Pro Se Attorneys, 34 B.C. L. Rev. 529, 533 (1993).

433fed9336746e07,Dougie's been warned about Canvassing but still insists on doing it.  He's been running around all over about this but here's a new twist.  What if the rumors are correct? We know Passions is ending within months and the rumors are happy endings all around including Theresa and Ethan. At that point CRANE won't be her name.  Why bounce the article every where when the show is within months from ending?  A woman's maiden name is always her name.  If she ends up marrying Ethan her name will change again.  This resistance to leave her as her maiden name is just silly.  On soaps women change their names all the time but the MAJORITY of articles stay at the maiden name.  This is one of a very few with a minority insisting on moving when majority says don't.,0,0,0,0,0,0,
