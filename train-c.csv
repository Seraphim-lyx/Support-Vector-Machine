0033b9d5ccd499fb,"""Is it scientific to attribute an event A, to cause B, where cause B was deliberate designed, with some sort of intelligent intent? Don't answer the questions beyond thatWell, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.  First, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.  Second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with """"probabilities"""". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don't understand it, you can't do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn't have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say """"well, it's so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it"""". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don't understand. ID is just making up their numbers.  Finally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that's all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, """"B"""" is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if """"A"""" were a dead body and """"B"""" were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that's what killed him. You don't have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, """"A"""", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you've never actually observed """"B"""". (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn't science.

The 1990 Constitution barred that as a possibility, and after the Kumanovo Military-Technical Agreement was signed between NATO and FRY the SRS broke its coalition with SPS and the government collapsed, causing new elections - because that was unconstitutional, as an act of highest treason, enough to be tried from maximum sentence (which the Radicals demanded from then to his death, to have a trial in Serbia, and to be tried for treason among other reasons).

0063a8786a7034fc,"""== Attributing and classifying of personalities == Invitation. Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed. Some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. My initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. We should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as  iurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India. Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. iurlionis is the best example here. In other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). We see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don't pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher Ramtnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).  period and generation  artists, writers, philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period, the younger generation, approx 1905 ?1930  painter and composer  iurlionis, painter Kazys ?monis, poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas - Vydtnas, dramatist Sofija Kymantait - iurlionien, poets Adomas Jak?as, Motiejus Gustaitis, Liudas Gira, composer Stasys ?mkus, philosopher Ramtnas Bytautas.  reformers and innovators of Lithuanian culture Representatives of Lithuanian culture, almost unknown before them.

I had a good laugh.User:Southofwatford  How strange that you should find it so funny, after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more informatioion about what is being sourced, so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny, it's simply bizarre. Equally, in the English Wikipedia I would argue that choosing a Spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in English does not make sense, except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing - your cynicism is evident in your response. 08:3",0,0,0,0,0,0

00ced92ee28c7ee8,"""66.185.85.80's rantPresently, we are witnessing  an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture.  Croatian Left often portrays this culture as """"primitive"""" and """"rural"""" (even """"fashist"""") being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, """"performed"""" on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition. Another """"apostle"""" of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergovi - refers to his political opponents on the Right as """"gusle players"""". Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all ?tokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljevi, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorovi's book """"Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje"""", 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijovi Koan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijovi Koan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatovi, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry.  Not far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska ?was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kai Mio? (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Kai's work, Ivan Me?rovi, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kai in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.  In addition to Kai, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Juri? (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banovi), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosovi-Kudri (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banovi ?Trli?(1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn't play gusle (it's    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound. Olinko Deloo Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar. The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  """"Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West"""" that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)This admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredeki: 麳rvatske narodne junake pjesme? ?eljezno-Be, p. 9)Now, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. Having this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock 'n' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre",0,0,0,0,0,0

But the final debate on 8 October was a mean Parliamentary occasion. Two days before, in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet, the Cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence, preferring to go out on the Campbell case to a defeat on the Russian Treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.麺iddlemas and Barnes, p. 273.

01726bfc7b29b8c9,""":::::::::: Tim, firstly I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline, and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour. Yes I certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in, there is clearly a massive diffence between, say having offices in the French or Japanese jurisdictions, or between the Chinese and U.S. jurisdictions, since the legal and regulatory systems are very different, as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets. Beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in, say, Paris or Toulouse, even though they are both in the same jurisdiction. I appreciate that the situation in the U.S. is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions. Even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though. To give an example, the San Jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the Los Angeles market, but it will also have a quite different profile - on the whole a lot more specialist, niche and focused on high tech.  To give another example, in the UK a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didn't have an office in London, even if it had offices in every other big city. In fact all of the very top tier UK firms (DLA Piper is not yet regarded as one of them, despite its size) have just one UK office, in London, although they have other offices overseas.  Saying that DLA has """" has 69 offices across the United States, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Thailand, China, ..."""" would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader. We could fall back on using descriptions like """"in major financial centres"""" or """"in major commercial centres"""" or """"in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres"""" but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness, imprecision and even original research. I do accept that DLA, with 69 offices, is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article. However I do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it, and should be included as much as possible.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

01754d101f511048,"""Nope, I didn't read the guide to appealing, didn't have time. The user in question IS engaged in harassment, I've been doing this long enough to know and I can prove it. He/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page, reverted the article while I was in the midst of editing it (my second pass, couldn't even preview changes), then changed his/her mind as to my real wiki-sin, since the onus for proving the Doris Day available as PD on archive.org was on him/her not me and the usual span for pre-Bern had expired long ago, ... decided my REAL sin was Original Research (oh noes), and continued to revert based on that. Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising about 1/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I'll tell you why: the user wasn't engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I'd guess it's some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don't really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn't directly related to content and improving articles. I could pretend this user didn't do what he/she did, but I'm wasting my own time here and I don't really have a stake in any such pretense. I don't have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative. As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don't see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn't me here, it's that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. Also, I don't recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently. His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems. I think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper, he/she isn't quite qualified for that at this point anyway, and it's having a very chilling effect across wikipedia.

Intellectual critics saw in these actions a want of guiding principle and a lack of solid theoretical knowledge. """"He believed in knowledge just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception,"""" Henry Adams wrote in a much-quoted analysis in 1870. """"He believed in common schools, and not in political science; in ledgers and cash-books, but not in Adam Smith or Mill; as one might believe in the multiplication-table, but not in Laplace or Newton. By a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice, and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusions.""""Henry Adams, """"The Session,"""" North American Review, July, 1870, p. 36.  But in a very corrupt time, it spoke well of Boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his Cabinet post, either for himself or his friends. Living within his salary, he lodged in a boarding-house throughout his tenure. His only pleasures lay in writing lectures and playing billiards or poker   though never for money. Chicago Times, March 6, 1875.  """"He is an inaccessible man, uninfluenced by fear, favor, affection or hope of reward, and does not burst out into brillian exhibitions of love or hatred,"""" a New England politician wrote his brother. Henry F. French to Benjamin B. French, March 16, 1869, Benjamin B. French Papers, Library of Congress.""""Boutwell's financial policy was less dogmatic than pragmatic.""""Liberal reformers had hoped that he would embrace civil service reform and rush the country towards the resumption of specie payments; but while Boutwell appointed subordinates on the basis of merit for the most part, , he did little to rein in the spoils system outside of Washington, remaining on friendly terms with the party bosses.''""""""",0,0,0,0,0,0

018aab4d87d613d3,""" Question on Possible Citation I'm sorry if I missed your question - I don't pay much attention to that page. In response to your question, let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation: The job of Wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view. (I haven't yet worked in """"no original research"""".) WP:NOR says that we mustn't integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions. Comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research. We can integrate information, so long as we don't arrive at new theories. Another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy. The more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate. Getting down to details, the Predators and Editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source. The Bauer site, even if somewhat unreliable, may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about Bauer. I'm not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct. However I would say that your proposed text appears reasonable. The sources are sufficient, and no original conclusions are made. The website takedown issue is confusing to me, but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. Overall, my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better. Attack articles are not encouraged. While we must show our subjects """"warts and all"""" we shouldn't enlarge the warts, nor ignore their better features. Balance is a part of NPOV. - """"but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources."""" There no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war. It is alleged the website takdown was instigated by Bauer. It isn't clear if she did, and other factors between the forum and the IP are not known. It was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs. I don't see how that can be objective.  Bauer I'm sorry I did not get back to you about the Usenet stuff et al., but I've been somewhat overloaded at work. Personally, I think the article is better now than when I first saw it, thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesn't seem like a lynch mob. Y'all are doing a good job, and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted . I'm glad to help and try and make the article neater, and I don't mean to sound brusque in the summary field, but there was a lot to cram in there. Thanks for the note, I appreciate it!    I would say Karen saying I've called her names is an out and out fabrication. I've never done any such thing. """"or whether it's because he's been able to insult me and call me names on Wikipedia, repeatedly and without consequences""""I've accused her and Jule of carrying the water for TNH and Absolutewrite and they have.

(Note: Not all of the sources I use below are in the article at present. The point here is to first convince RFC respondents that """"philosopher"""" is accurate and widely accepted, then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place.) Definitions Obviously, each source is going to use slightly different phrasing. Some will call him explicitly a """"philosopher"""" or has views on """"philosophy"""", but I think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent.

[ the Lau Philip """"LA"""" interview]. 3 entries marked """"Reference and support of , Written Reference"""" [chris, cook, rhee], obviously a request by the founder to a friend/colleague write a letter of support, that was never published anyway and isn't cited so you can't have read it (not that it was even possibly valid evidence). A short writeup of a """"local information"""" kind, on the award of the first 4 black belts by the school, in its local paper.In brief of the 11: 5 were before the sport existed and were not even remotely to do with the topic itself much less """"sourced"""" material on it or """"substantial"""" coverage (they had precisely zero coverage);  3 were claims of personal """"I think  is a great guy"""" letters of support, evidently solicited and/or written on request, with zero evidence of verifiable existence, and certainly in no way reliably sourced or independent;  1 was self-written 1 was the briefest of non-mentions in a non-reliable source (pretty much """"I discussed the topic with them"""" in a college magazine interview) 1 is local press coverage of his courses that's not even """"news for a day""""  or evidence of anything beyond """"a course by this name is taught twice weekly in our local village hall"""".Your assessment of these, at AFD, was: It is reliably sourced{| style=""""border:#c0c0c0 solid 1px"""" width=""""90%""""|  There is barely one reliable source in all of those 11 that the sport even exists in the first place (!) - a local newspaper mention that it meets in a village hall on tuesdays and fridays and just awarded its first 4 black belts.

01d14606bf9ea4ba,""" stradbroke galleon / portuguese hallo Moondyne, I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments. I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information. The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by """"mainstream"""" academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the """"mainstream"""" view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian's mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian's antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different. Still it is dissapointing. Happy trails.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

01e325ea4bf0f8a3,""" Why confusion and controversy in the """"real world"""" does not preclude the writing of a good Wikipedia on the topic Ackoz suggests that, because the real world has not yet hashed out """"the truth"""" about the expulsions, it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it.I reject such a stance.  I think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality Wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and/or controversial.  Where many Wikipedia editors """"get it wrong"""" is that they believe Wikipedia's job is to report the truth.  This is wrong.  Wikipedia's job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is.  Any attempt to do that is original research.Instead of """"truth"""", Wikipedia aims for """"verifiability"""".  Put a different way, Wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion (not our opinions but those of reliable sources).  If the truth is clear and uncontroversial, it is easy for us to report that.  If the truth is murky and controversial, it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic EVEN if these reliable sources conflict.  Where Wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents """"THE TRUTH"""" and not just one perspective (or POV) on the topic at hand.I have been trying to hit this NPOV """"sweet spot"""" but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides. Obviously is, because some users (Jadger and Wikiferdi) don't want to discuss in fact, they want us to agree with their POV, that's not discussion about the NPOV edits.

I am open to any collaboration|effort for the above goals.I am expecting that this user """"Laveol"""" will continue with the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of Republic of Macedonia, simply because he is able to, and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda.Ours is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the Facts about the Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Lanugage|Culture|Sports.Damemk, I hope you write something here, at least to show that User_talk:Damemk and User_talk:Ejanev is not the same user.    Some insight into my user name EjanevThe only user I am using to contribute to Wikipedia is """"Ejanev"""". It is composed of the first letter of my name """"Emil"""" and my last name """"Janev"""".User """"Damemk"""" is a separate user. Probably that user name is comming from """"Dame"""" - a Macedonian First name, and """"mk"""" or the code of """"Republic of Macedonia"""".It does happen that I am from Canada. I was born in Republic of Macedonia and have lived there until I moved to USA first and Canada before more than 3 years.And yes, having all the false information from the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda ( originating from the 19th century ) and having it into 21st century to be used to negate the Macedonian Nation and all it's attributes by users as """"Laveol"""", is the reason of some of my editing actions in Wikipedia.I am not the only user/editor from Republic of Macedonia or with Macedonian origin that has the same views for this Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda, that already is infiltrated in the Macedonian articles.You can watch the contributions of Special:Contributions/Laveol and see that more than 50% of his actions are engagement in negating the Macedonian Nation and its attributes.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

You know, as opposed to being a piece of Zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced.This entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. It is well documented the Banu Qurayza were executed for treason. That is what merited them the death penalty, that they commited treason. The Quarash and other tribes the Muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. But the Qurayza signed a peace treaty, then broke it by aiding the enemy. This article contains soo much jewish propaganda that you'd think they were executed for no reason (which no doubt is their aim). Here is a great example. Look at this citation""""According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: """"Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery."""" Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.""""This author is Norman A Stillman, a Zionist Jew who is very biased. Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article? And further more, why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used, as if it's a fact?There are articles for """"Criticisms of Islam"""" where the Jews and others can write whatever they want. But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles. Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there. You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews, without it disappearing instantly. So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles. Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view, and the jews can write their responses in appropriate """"criticisms of Islam"""" articles. If not, I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. And I will find a non-Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles.Good day.  Please read this talk page, specifically all of the places where """"treason"""" or """"traitor"""" is mentioned, and if you still believe that we need to mention treason, provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it.  It is easy for our article to be neutral and mention all POVs, but it does require that people like yourself participate.  We work from academic sources, not personal conjecture.   Changes by Devotus and issues with themDear Devotus, I have still issues with your changes:Bat Yeor and Ramadan - while I appreciate that you don't try you shift the balance - removing a book from """"each side"""" - I do not agree with your removal. Bat Yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial, she is not beyond the pale - currently she doesn't serve as a reference in the article but if she did, the controversy would be noted. As for Ramadan I have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section, we would have to remove him from the article too, in which he serves as a reference. This is due to the insistence of User:Bless sins. He will certainly not like such a removal. We cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.While your first version was needlessly verbose (""""it is to be noted that""""), the new one endorses that view by Paret/Watt. The article now says that the BQ were not killed for religious reasons - that is not a fact, since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences.Also we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the """"siege and demise"""", e.g. the claim about attacking M. in the rear.Also, please abide by the one resolved conflict.

0270bbf8002b4476,"Well, Arthur, I have printed the paper, and the condition is in fact what Ultra.Power says it is, not your correction. It seems that the paper is not incorrect, but rather correct and pointless.You have already identified the worst problem: The third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. However, this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. So let's do that.We want a function f satisfying f(1)=e and f(n+1)=exp(f(n)), defined as widely as possible. We observe that n=0 and n=1 present no problems: f(0)=1 and f(-1)=0.To extend f to all positive real numbers, it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1, such as [0,1).And we want f to be continuously differentiable. (The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on (0,1), or equivalently on (-1,0). This is obviously whacky, but we needn't worry about this because a=e.)Next, for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interval [0,1]. From the functional equation f(x) = ln f(x+1) we get f '(x) = f '(x+1)/f(x+1). Hence f '(-1)=f '(0)/f(0)=f '(0), so f ' must be constant on [0,1]! Not too surprisingly, the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x) = exp[x](exp(x-[x])).Thus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between -1 and 0.",0,0,0,0,0,0

For exampleand this is... yep, maybe you guessed it... question 2: Why is it supposedly """"okay"""" (according to you) for someone with a name... like, say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack, but not for me to give him one back because I'm just a lowly IP-editor? Specifically, why is it supposedly """"okay"""" for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of """"ebaY"""" logo to go next to the current one, """"ebay,"""" in the lead, is """"because I wanted it in there,"""" even though that is a total lie; but it's supposedly """"not okay"""" for me to call that kind of slander stupid?3.

To reiterate my original explanatoin to James: I'm interested in this more on a meta level (how do we approach controversial subjects) than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards Moore and his film; that is, I'm trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about.  For an encyclopedia based around the concept of a Neutral Point of View, any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is, in itself, an editorial statment seems wrong; such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article.  See, for example, something like Roe v. Wade  there's no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case.  Even if you really consider Moore's movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda (and to risk the Wiki-equivalent of Godwin's Law here), note that the article on Triumph of the Will doesn't feel the need to explain all the reasons why Nazi Germany wasn't all it was cracked up to be.   Similarly, shouldn't we just describe the content of the movie (noting that it is controversial), and then if we want an article about the Bin Laden family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there?   20:19, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)",0,0,0,0,0,0

Usage of words like """"exhibit"""" and """"attitude"""", and refusing to follow the section title requirements on my page, show an obvious malfeasance intent by the above person, and therefore the block cannot be valid because within the first sentence he has already seriously demonstrated his lack of appropriate intent by specifically and purposefully being antagonizing.  The second claim is physically possible, but is blatantly false.

0334049b60e326b8,"And PaganismSouthgate, who has a degree in theology and religious studies from Canterbury University, rejected Catholicism and moved towards neo-pagan and heathen groups that are ?ery loyal to the Gods of the Northern Tradition? including the Odinic Rite, the Tribe of the Wulfings and the A ?satru?Alliance, a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by Valguard (Mike) Murray, a former member of the American Nazi Party.91 Further evidence of this transition from Catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with Wotan, the organ of the Charlemagne Hammer Skins.92 Southgate believed that Wotan? celebration of the heroes of the Norse pantheon represented ?he most genuine expression of European spirituality, culture and identity?93 Another key expression of this ?dentity?is exhibited by Southgate? interest in the militaristic cult of Mithras and the ?agan spirituality?of the apostate Roman emperor Julian II.94This rejection of Christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension. Through the figure of Christ, Christianity has Judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted; only the ?eak?continue to worship a ?ead Jew?95 The emphasis on the Jmphasis on the Judaic roots of Christianity, however, is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals, sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion Mithras, which was introduced into Iran and India by marauding Aryan tribes from the Russian steppes between BCE 2000 and 1500 before spreading to the Roman empire. Although it failed to defeat early Christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century, Mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers (including Evola and Jung) as an alternative path the West could have followed. It retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the Knights Templar or, latterly, Himmler? SS which, the NRF claims, had its origins in various ?narchist droite ?circles l e the Black Sun and the Thule Society. While Christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the ?ryan psyche? the awareness of Europe? ?austian?destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu. These ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like Evola and Rene?Gue?on who discerned in them the fragments of a ?idden albeit distinct and fundamental truth?96 For Southgate, as for Evola, Tradition is an ?n underlying current which both permeates and transcends all?97Southgate? discovery of Evolian ?rimordial Tradition?and his consequent rejection of Catholicism as ?he sole cosmological truth?ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene.98 This ?ultural vanguard?is spearheaded by a number of Gothic-Industrial, Dark Ambient, Black and ?iking?Metal bands, including Allerseelen, Blood Axis, Burzum, Current 93, Dark Holler, Death in June, Endura, Mayhem, Ostara, Puissance hem, Ostara, Puissance and Sol Invictus, though it also encompasses more commercial bands like Cradle of Filth.99 Although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda, their music serves to diffuse the ideals of Mithraic paganism and Nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could, thus providing the ?erfect antidote?to the spiritually enervating, multiracial values of a globalizing ?ystem? Southgate has also noted the potential of the Straight Edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers, an interesting development given (exaggerated) reports of an emerging ?nti-anti-establishment?pro-Bush right-wing punk movement.100 Although Southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control music-orientated youth cultures, he believes a minority can be induced ?o take a direction basically conducive to our aims?101 Southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine Synthesis, which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews.102This is not simply cynical manipulation. Southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target. His fanzine, Tribal Resonance, ?he voice of the racial avant-garde? reveals Southgate? strategy of linking his ideas to ?he common language and the big ideas of our culture?103 Through the mediough the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives 黤rom without? Southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally, as the Nazis did, through a process of 點ultural osmosis?that aims to recode the 黶ocial symbology?of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic, recalibrating its genetic inheritance.

Now, do you mean the real P(omega), or do you mean that M1 satisfies """"P(omega) exists""""  that is, that there's an element of M1 that M1 thinks is P(omega)?

033d78bf5ab10000,"""Justin Vaisse's opinionThis relative absence of French-American political and social unity helps to explain anti-French sentiment in the United States. French historian Justin Va?sse has proposed that an important cause of overtly expressed public hostility toward France in the United States is the small number of Americans of direct French descent1. http://www.politiqueinternationale.com/revue/article.php?id_revue=12&id;=228&content;=synopsis. While he acknowledges that this is not the direct cause of anti-French sentiments, he argues that it explains why these sentiments can be expressed publicly, without being seen as a gross violation of political correctness. Va?sse contends that by comparison, the public display of such sentiments towards other ethnic groups or nationalities would be met by strong disapproval. He proposes that as France has no powerful and organised lobby to defend it, it is socially and politically acceptable in the United States to express negative sentiments of the FrenchPierre Verdaguer, """"A Turn-of-the-Century Honeymoon? The Washington Post's Coverage of France"""", French Politics, Culture & Society, vol. 21, no. 2, summer 2003. Just to answer, I've read before that the proportion of french descendant in the US is way higher than thought because as the french colonized the New World at the same time as the Brits but got outnumbered pretty quickly, they were mixed into the mainstream america. However it's true that since most of them lost traces of their heritage no lobby exists nor defends them as they don't represent or try to represent.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

However my understanding was that Wikipedia was explicitly not in the advocacy business and that its articles should be named with the commonest term.  In this case the commonest term occurs ten times as often as the other two terms.This name has the further benefit of being self-explanatory, whereas those unfamiliar with either of the other two names would have to consult a dictionary when they encounter it in a text, which may well be why it is by far the commonest term.I therefore propose moving this article to Stiffness to weight ratio and linking the other two terms to it.

I am not sure what you mean by """"reverting the article upside down""""; my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles.

You are right that the work of a person is most important.However, there are much present and past propaganda, which destroy the peace.

It cost me more then here on En Wiki to settle the Pl article well. So sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude, possibly I explained more my excitement.With Silesian is in short like this: Originally, they were Slavic tribe, spoke Polish, as I mentioned. For some 300 to 500 hundred years there were under German governments. They had bad time as you possibly can imagine. Many of them married with German and were/are of course confused who they are. You know, the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course Polish-German conflicts continued. Finally in 1945 Poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives. Even those who honestly considered himself Polish Silesians at the end of war could be persecuted. There in Poland was complete disorder. Soviets and Coommunists arrived, most of them real simpletons any way. ?ational?government - just pro-soviet mafia, was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition. Polish borders were shifted. We lost some 20% of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west Poland. You can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all, some of them completely simple people. They spoke different Polish dialect also. On top of this in the post war, pro-soviet atmosphere criminals found good playground. Well, I do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds ?unfortunately I am. This is like gangrene on fresh wound, literally. Thus many of the native Silesian could be robber in Poland, which they wanted so much. I believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be Germans.Now, the present time, some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology ?they could be absolutely right. However, there are many Germans who want their property back ack and some just using opportunity to stir in internal Polish affairs - despite the final border agreement between Poland and Germany signed on 14 November 1990 and governments effort to improve relations.Finaly I have to say, I beleave that Polish are hospitable and very often na?ve. Not many realize that politic need caution. Those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the na?ves. Some procentage remember lectures of history, and objectively, too many Germans are toublemakers. I am also convinced there exists something like national character. You can have obviously you own opinion, let me have my own.Returning to Silesians it is something close to squaring the circle . I wish the true Silesian all the best but I do not want Fith Column  on Polish terytory in addition.Sorry if I used posibly ofencive """"reverting the article upside down"""" that was in the heat of the battle, wich I still have with Ge Wiki. They just arogantly do not answer if they do not like and refuse mediatior at any imaginative pretext. That sucks.Sorry and thanks again.

In reality, JayJG is a rabid Zionist and is trying to purge Wikipedia of any negative information about Zionism, and is trying to paint Muslims in a bad light.  Along with many of his cohorts.The problem is that JayJG is part of the Wikipedia cabal.  When there were elections, despite massive efforts to the contrary, a number of people got a higher vote percentage than JayJG - but Jimbo Wales put him on ArbCom anyhow.  Jimbo has shown his true colors as well.These people control Wikipedia.  They are all together, and attacking you.  No one is coming to your aid.  This is because they control Wikipedia, with Jimbo at the center, and have more or less driven off everyone else.  You are banging your head against a wall here - any massacre by Zionists against Palestinians will be covered up, disorted, justified etc., anyone who attacks an Israeli soldier will be castigated here.My suggestion is to direct your efforts to somewhere more creative, like a wiki encyclopedia that is not pro-Zionist and anti-Muslim like this one.

As such, the photo may not be used on Wikipedia, except perhaps under fair use policy (which probably doesn't apply), or under panorama freedom (depending on what the copyright law of India says on this topic).:Image:Bipasha.jpg - Image description page implies that it is licensed for non-commercial use only (contradicting your copyright tag); such a restriction is not acceptable on Wikipedia. In addition, the link to the original source (which could clarify which condition is correct) of the image is missing.:Image:Bom.jpg - The link to the original source at flickr is missing; author uploads images to flickr as """"all rights reserved"""". :Image:Chowpatti.jpg - To verify that the image is indeed under the license you claim, the author should probably e-mail the Wikimedia Foundation and confirm that it is indeed under that license.:Image:Hydmall.jpg - The flickr page states that it is under a Creative Commons No-Derivative license; a license that prohibits the image to be modified/used in derivative works is not acceptable on Wikipedia, either.:Image:Infobangalore.jpg - No evidence of the image being under a free license.:Image:Brigaderoad.jpg - Flickr page states """"all rights reserved"""".:Image:Hoogly.jpg - The link to the original source at flickr is missing; author uploads images to flickr as """"all rights reserved"""".:Image:Haf.jpg - Flickr page states """"all rights reserved"""".:Image:Bangtemp.jpg - Creative Commons No-Derivative license.:Image:Kolkahomes.jpg - All rights reserved.:Image:Delhimall.jpg - Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial No-derivative license (unacceptable on Wikipedia).:Image:Yamun.jpg - All rights reserved.:Image:Kolk.jpg - All rights reserved.:Image:Myspalbang.jpg - All rights reserved.:Image:Bangalore.jpg - The link to the original source is missing; no evidence that it is under the Creative Commons license.:Image:Lalbagh.jpg - Taken from WikiTravel. Uploader ought to confirm that he is indeed under the author and that he has licensed it under the license indicated.:Image:Nagpur.JPG - Who made this image?There are several issues here. There are multiple Creative Commons licenses, not all of which are acceptable on Wikipedia. In particular, licenses that prohibit commercial use or making of derivative works are considered unfree and can't be used on Wikipedia, except as provided by the fair use policy; Creative Commons Atrribution, and Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike licenses are okay. Also, there are multiple versions of the licenses; Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 are all distinct licenses. (The problem is that the upload dialogue only lists the 3.0 versions and not the earlier ones; when the image is under one of the older licenses, you ought to edit the image description page and correct the number. As far as I can see, Flickr only uses the 2.0 versions of the licenses.)In addition, some of the Flickr authors have indicated that they allow the image to be used on Wikipedia, without making it clear that they release it under one of the acceptable licenses; a permission that only extends to Wikipedia is not sufficient, either. You should ask the authors to do one of the following:Change the Flickr page to license the image under Creative Commons Attribution (or Attribution Sharealike) license (apparently, this would change the licensing for all images, and this may not be what they intend to do);Post a message to the image page with a text similar to the following:I, creator of the image, agree to license it under the Creative Commons Attribution license (link) [alternately: under the Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike license (link). This declaration overrides any statement to the contrary on this page.E-mail the Wikimedia Foundation (permissions-en[AT]wikimedia[DOT]org) with a message similar to the above, also specifying which image (images) the user intends to release under the license.

As my response there indicates I don't share your opinion, but I understand where you're coming from. In that comment you also said """"I'd really like to avoid protecting them for the duration if that can be avoided, but if you keep bringing issues to my attention, I'll do my utmost to make your life easier"""". So this is the """"bring the issues to your attention"""" on my part. See this 3RR request  filed by User:Kudzu1. It's sort of gone past """"lots of disruptive anon IPs"""" causing trouble on these pages, to pretty much full blown sock puppetry and abuse of multiple accounts by at least - though likely, more - one person. So. How can my life be made easier? SPI? I already filed one, on one sock master  (though that's probably a different person) and some other users have filed others (for example ). The problem is - and notice that a CU has not even gotten around to the SPI I filed - that by the time the CUs get around to considering these cases, the person(s) behind these accounts have already thrown them away and moved onto new SPAs which keep doing the same thing. Not sure what the best course of action here is but it's helluva frustrating trying to deal with this.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

(not to mention his personal talk page is one big anti-Greek rant fest pointing to questionable FYROM news sources with highly exaggerated sensationalist titles)""""No, Assfuckers (has a nice ring to it D) use it as a pejorative term. I was ready to pull the trigger on both him, admin Futper, and a few others (e.g. Macedoniaboy who says he is a """"proud fighter for united Macedonia on his talk page) with a detailed complaint about anti-Greek propaganda but since Futper managed a civil discussion with me and now seems to be sticking to debating articles (rather than threats of blocking)  I'm going to avoid escalating this further for now. ns. As for the current naming disputing article... I agree with you that some FYROM citizens honestly believe their claims but I don't think that reduces the existential threat to Greece. Communism fell 17 years ago in Yugoslavia and the FYROM government appears to be getting worse not better (imagine if in two hundred years they call themselves """"ethnic Athenians"""" and the cycle continues until their is no Greece left). There appear to be important quotes missing from the naming dispute article that clearly demonstrate that FYROM leadership are confused about their own national identity (and confusing their own citizens in the process unfortunately). I tried to add this to the talk page of the article but Futper deleted it (arguing ancient Macedon is unrelated to the article even though his own editing history shows him adding an edit arguing that ancient Macedon wasn't Greek) I didn't want to get into a revert war over simply a discussion of perceived facts but since I didn't think those facts should be censored either I thought perhaps you could add them to discussion on the naming dispute talk page.

There is some confusion about our identity.""""'I think the above needs to be compared to that of their current hard line prime minister's recent behavior.

03f3487fdc578875,""" Some tips for making your stubs a bit better Apart from your over-reliance on Soccerway (which isn't always a WP:RS), I've noticed there are some other aspects of your created articles which need substantial improvement. Typing """"player who plays"""" is poor English, try to put """"footballer who plays..."""" or """"soccer player who represents..."""" The word """"currently"""" is pretty pointless too - I mean, they either play for the team or they don't, right? Also, try not to say they play for Bayern Munich in the Frauen-Bundesliga. Put of the Frauen-Bundesliga instead, because they play matches for their teams outside the league too. Please remember to always put the stub tags at the bottom of the article, this will draw attention to the fact that your creations require expansion and improvement. These are just small suggestions, but hopefully by taking this advice you will get better and eventually take some steps on the path to becoming a worthwhile contributor. Thanks,   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

By the Cabal's conclusion...If the article had happened to be frozen at Myanmar before the mediation, and we had the same Cabal, it would now be a Myanmar article. I can see where the Myanmar side would be unhappy. However why should the Burma side agree to abide by the next decision? You can bet that with every panel of mediators that might side with Myanmar you will find at least as many panels that side with Burma. Husond is right, where does this end? When I first looked at this mess I said, and posted, that with the current evidence on both sides editors and mediators will NOT be able to reach a FAIR compromise that will appease both sides of this issue... no matter how much thought is put into it. There are good points for each argument. I'm in the Burma camp but that is how I see things. So I'm looking at 1) leave it where it is now, 2) split it into 2 identical articles, 3) some bizarre bot that switches it back and forth daily, 4) a new type of mediation that imho will not end this by any stretch of the imagination.

Two such books, by Susan Bayly and Christophe Jaffrelot, both widely used in universities around the world, both reviewed extensively in the literature, are being used in the article.

I am used to accepting correction when it is due, but for the life of me I cannot understand why cited information from a primary source (RSA Labs) on the fourth factor of authentication is not worth knowing.  I am confronted with the information that because it is not a legal requirement as far as you know, it must be spurious.  Some people know that it's better to get their legal information from government sources, not Wikipedia.  If you are holding up this resource as some type of CFR or USC guide, exposition, or sanctioned resource, then I believe the U.S. Government would like to hear your ideas.  Further, """"someone you know"""" (or knows you) is part of network administrationwhich is part of the brilliance.  Needing a cohort or supervisor to provide a human factor is difficult to defeat.  Though, I suspect you know this already.  I'm not offended though, just immensely confused as to why this item of access control must be devoid of technical information and meet some arbitrary legal standard.  I would ask you this: if a user loses their SmartCard (i.e. CAC) and forgets their password, with the premise being that biometric devices or other inherence factor methodologies are not deployed, in most situations does an administrator with knowledge of the user ask they be terminated, or do they reissue credentials based on knowing the person?  There are organizations that will terminate you, but I couldn't have said that in my expounding of the 4th factor because it would mean citing information not available to the lay. (I do hope I can """"talk"""" without citing what those in DF and IS would consider common knowledge.)  When we set out, it was to provide reliable information, if the mission has changed, well who could tell?  Consider me a non-contributor from now onwe aren't allowed to use Wikipedia anyway where I work, it is an anathema.  Say what you want unless it surprises someone and then an ego check is issued. I should expect nothing less, after all, I teach.  What changed the tone was your dumbing-down and use of nonsensical examples that could not be used to authenticate someone.  Smell?  Non-sequitur.  You gave me things to read, but I'm still waiting for you to cite Wikipedia's policy that information be legally sanctioned and in the format expected by a barrister.  I cited my sourcewhere is the citation that the language style, organization, and applicability be in-line with one or more regulatory bodies?Now a better way to be proactive would be to realize that academic databases (do you have access to them [Elsevier, JSTOR, EDAS, IEEE, SpringerLink], they can be pricey if you try and yet without them you're stuck in a Google funk, but I digress) are full of references to fourth factor.

See http://biblio-archive.unog.ch/archivplan.aspx.  By reviewing five books dealing with Einstein's work and life - not a single one mentioned this Einstein's support to the Ustase cause. Just one, written in German,Einstein: Sein Leben by Denis Brian, Christine von Samson-Mark, Wiley-VCH, 2005 page 352Indem er sich den Angelegenheiten seines eigenen Landes zuwandte, empoerte sich Einstein ueber deutsche Studenten, die fuer die Entlassung eines Professors agitierten, weil dieser ein Pazifist gegen politisch motivierte Todesurteile war. """"Es ist entsertzlich zu sehen, wie die unerfahrene Jugend fehlgeleitet wird"""", schrieb er an das Berliner Tageblatt. """"Wenn dies so weitergeht, werden wir nach einer Tyrannei der Faschisten bei einer Herrschaft des Rotten Terrors ankommen."""" Er glaubte, dass eine solche Herrschaft bereits in Jugoslawien ausgeloest worden sei und kritisierte die Landesregierung fuer den Mord an dem kroatischen Fuehrer, Professor Milan Sufflay, der Geschichte an der Universitaet von Zagreb gelehrt hatte.Reading further this book it is clear that the only information available to Einstein was 'The """"inside story"""" of the ?fflay murder was given by the Croat journalist (Ustase propagandist), Slavko Cihlar, in the Berliner Tageblatt, February 26, 1931.'So, it is apparent that Einstein fell under spell of the Ustase propaganda. About the same propaganda, see:Appeal of the Croatian Academicians to the World of Civilisation: How the Croatian Savant, Professor of University, Dr. Milan Sufflay was Murdered by the Serbian Royal Dictatorshipby Croatian University clubs association, Zagreb, 1931 32 pageswhich was elaborated by """"Blood and Homeland"""": Eugenics and Racial Nationalism in Central and Southeast Europe, 1900-1940by Marius Turda, Paul Weindling, Central European University Press, 2007 page 107Shortly afterwards, students from the Croatian University Club Association produced an English language pamphlet, How the Croatian Savant, Professor of University Dr. Milan ?fflay, was Murdered by the Serbian Royal Dictatorship, in which they appealed to European public opinion to recognize that the murder of ?fflay was the result of endeavors to build an absolutist South Slav state. In such a state, the """"European culture"""" of Croatia and the Croatian was to be replaced by Serbian suzerainty, in which """"orthodox, byzantine, oriental-asiatic and oldtuc (sic) political and social traditions"""" had been subsumed into a system """"not only contrary but also odious to European culture""""Turda also says that """"His murder occasioned international condemnation and outrage from, among others, Albert Einstein and Heinrich Mann of the German League for the Rights of Man"""" (no source was given)About the Sufflay murdererThinking about Yugoslavia: Scholarly Debates about the Yugoslav Breakup and the Wars in Bosnia and Kosovo by Sabrina P. Ramet, Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 254Goldstein (Croatian historian) leaves the question of agency to the side and writes simply that ?fflay, who, as he notes, was an accomplished observer of Albanian culture, 'was killed on the street in Zagreb. The killers were never found"""" see also: Croatia: A Historyby Ivo Goldstein, translated by Nikolina Jovanovic,  McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 1999 - page 125About the same SufflayWomen, Gender, and Fascism in Europe, 1919-45: 1919-1945 By Kevin Passmore, Manchester University Press, 2003 page 115, Fascism in Croatia chapter: Ante Starcevic and Milan ?fflay, who used a demonic concept of Serbs as the cornerstone of their ideologies.Conflicts: Studies in Contemporary History by Lewis Bernstein Namier, Macmillan, 1942 page 49The racial theories of a Croat writer named ?fflay were taken up since Sufflay had held that the Croats were not Slavs like the Serbs, bu were descendants of a settlement of Goths.War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941-1945: Occupation and Collaboration by Jozo TomasevichPublished by Stanford University Press, 2001 page 20:Sufflay was indicted in 1921 for espionage and connections with Croatian emigres and sentenced to athree year prison termBottom line: the story about Einstein's support to the Ustase cause is one-sided and even false.72.75.20.29  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

04c231ddb0a06522,"A consistent conceptualization of phylogenies Phylogenies (i.e., dictomously branching processes) are processes that involve things, that is, objects, and as such have to be modeled by Object-Oriented Modeling in order to be consistent with the distinction of objects. Darwins model of evolution illustrates biological species as objects, and is thus no different from phylogenies of other kinds of objects (like asexually reproducing cells or mitochondria). Now, as an Object-Oriented Model, the model actually represents two consecutive objects (i.e., two objects in a row) by each of its internal lines (i.e., lines between nodes): one after a node and one before a node; the former belonging to the category (i.e., concept) 'objects after nodes' and the latter to the category 'objects before nodes'. If the model includes all objects of a certain category, then both of these make up this category. In summary: phylogenies consist of two categories (i.e., concepts) of objects: objects before nodes and objects after nodes, and if the phylogeny includes all things of a category, then these two categories make up this category.(Cladistics, or cladism as I prefer to call it, confuses the concept 'objects after nodes' with the concept 'objects before nodes' by defining lines between nodes as single things, thereby confusing category with object, that is kind with thing, thus confusing conceptualization itself. The approach is actually a return to a pre-scientific stage, this time denying the incompatibility between pattern and process instead of acknowledging it and solving it consistently. It is a return alley that no scientist had ever expected anyone to advocate. If this approach could ever be proved to be correct, then it would mean that reality only exists in our own heads. Luckily, Einstein's discovery that time is relative to space falsifies the approach (i.e., claim), and this it did even before the approach was born. Cladism was thus shown to be wrong before it emerged). Consist (presently at 83.254.20.53  )",0,0,0,0,0,0

Is Algeria """"minor?"""" Iran? It's a nonsense phrase, so it should be deleted. As for making """"MA"""" a country code for Western Sahara, it's not. MA is a code for Morocco, and so it is in Morocco's infobox. EH was created for Western Sahara, so that is its country code. As far as the territory being occupied, this is a clear fact and the position of the United Nations; it is also mentioned in the article in other places. -?C? It does not need a definition to be in the article. A minor state is used as opposed to super-power states, permanent members of the security council, ... etc. As to the EH domain, it clearly states the .eh tld is intended for WS but it is not assigned, """".MA"""" being the one used in the territory. The same thing applies for the currency, the MAD is the currency of Morocco, but that is also the currency you will find in use in the territory. The same thing goes for the IAC 212, the Time zone +0 UTC, etc. They are the ones used in the territory. These things have been a matter of hotted debate before and they settled on the way they have been before you started tempering with them. As to your ridiculous claim of the UN considering the territory as occupied, I already explained to you the difference between a UN position through the security council that is reiterated again and again, and a voting poll in 1979 of the Algerian-Cuban drafted document, that has no obligation on the UN. The """"Zionism=Racism"""" example is the brightest one for you to understand it. I will revert to the version that was in use before the anon IP started this mess.  It does Since """"minor states"""" doesn't mean anything, you can't use it in this article; it's nonsense. What states that """".ma"""" is being used in the territory? Do you have any evidence of this at all? The same thing does not apply to currency, since there is no administrative body that assigns currencies to regions. To ask which currency is used in a region is different than to ask which top-level domain name has been assigned to the region; the former is defined entirely by usage, the latter is defined entirely by standards. Western Sahara is clearly occupied, as the article itself still states; I'm not going through this with you again. -?C?  Ah we're back to having fun again arguing about trivialities. Minor states is indeed a value judgement - although arguably the states recognizing are largely minor on the global arena (Algeria is not a big newsmaker per se). But in the interest of neutrality, merely noting """"African, Asian, and Latin American"""" states seems reasonable. At the same time, if Koavf gets to bleat on about minor, it seems reasonable that controlled be used rather than occupied. Same standards on language. (  ) Evidence on .ma usage would be found with sites for entities ostensibly domiciled in Western Sahara provinces using .ma. It is trivially easy to find that. Koavf's immature partisanship notwithstanding. (  )What is an example of a website with an .ma domain name which has the server in Western Sahara? ? D. Trebbien (talk) 23:40 2008 May 5 (UTC) Good question. Since effectively all internet service to the Western Sahara is via Maroc Telecom or other Moroccan operators, one would expect that most servers would be located in Moroccan territory (ex-WS provinces), largely in the Casa-Rabat area. Technically I am unaware of any way to determine where the physical server is actually located (versus the service). Presumably the Regional Investment Office of Laayoune (http://www.laayouneinvest.ma/fr/index.asp) may have its server physically in Laayoune. Other similar offices may also. It strikes me as useful for the article to indicate like country code, most sites use the Moroccan address (.ma). Polisario partisans may not like that, but its effective reality.

0512db238fec2eb7,"""Mario Party 4 is the fourth in a series of board game style video games for Nintendo platforms, featuring popular Nintendo characters. It was released on the Nintendo GameCube in North America on October 21, 2002 strangely before the Japanese release on November 8, 2002. It was released on November 29, 2002 in Europe, being heavily criticised for being 'Nintendo's big GameCube Game' for Christmas 2002 as Metroid Prime was delayed until March 2003.Mario Party 4 was the first Mario Party that was released on the Nintendo GameCube. Each board had its own host, including Toad, Goomba, Shy Guy, Koopa, and Boo. Mario Party 4 also contains some characters new to the franchise; Thwomp and Whomp. Klepto, Dolphin, Lakitu, and Star, along with two completely new characters named Genie of the Lamp and Ztar, are included as well. Mario Party 4 retains the Story Mode found in Mario Party 3.The game, as usual, contains a standard party mode in which up to four players play through a board, trying to collect as many Stars as possible. The Star Space would appear randomly on the board, and players would have to reach it before anyone else. However, the Stars carry a price tag of 20 coins, and player has to earn those coins by winning minigames, which take place at the end of each turn (after all the players have rolled the Dice Block, which will always roll a number from one to ten).Battle minigames are like the 4-player games, but generally (with many exceptions) a little more elaborate. Battle games are usually tense because every player has to put a certain number of coins (from 5 - 50) into a pot. First place gets 70% of the pot, second place gets 30%, and a random player gets any coins lost in rounding. Every Mario Party contains 60 to 80 minigames of a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which all players compete against each other. 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames put players in groups, so they have to cooperate in the minigame to win, even though they are against each other in the main game. In most situations, winners of these games make 10 coins each.A new addition to the Mario Party series was the Bowser mini-games. Players play in a very elaborate mini-game that ends when one player is eliminated in various ways. (See Bowser mini-game section below) The loser loses a pre-specified item, usually coins or items.GameplayBoards Toad's Midway Madness Goomba's Greedy Gala Koopa's Seaside Soiree Shy Guy's Jungle Jam Boo's Haunted Bash Bowser's Gnarly Party (Clear Story Mode to unlock it)SpacesThere is various spaces you can land in the game. The following is a list of them, and what they do.Blue Space - You get three coins. Also, there is a special feature on this game called Hidden Blocks, in which a star or coins may be hidden on random blue spaces.Red Space - You lose three coins.Green Happening Space - A special board event takes place.Warp Space - You are sent to the same space as an opponent. A spinner chooses which opponent's space you will warp to.Mushroom Space - Two boxes will appear (one big and one small). Choose one, and you will be given either a Mini Mushroom or a Mega Mushroom. (Note: The Mega Mushroom is not always in the large box, and the Mini Mushroom is not always in the small box.)Battle Space - A battle minigame will start in which players put a chosen amount of coins into a pot. The better you finish in the minigame, the more coins you will get back from the pot.Bowser Space - Bowser may steal items from players or a Bowser minigame may begin.Fortune Space - A reversal of fortune begins, in which players may have to give coins or stars to others.

0525305ab014194a,""" Hie DVdm. I was writing what follows while you made your edit. I can't right now, but I will coming to review in detail your example.Thanks Johnuniq for your advice and input. Concerning the actual statement, I had already thought that after clearing things up with DVdm, I would rephrase it into something in the lines of """"He is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late 1970s, early 1980s."""" Adding """"to some of the generation"""" should clear your objection about the absence of stats. But that's not the really important issue here. The fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from Wikipedia to declare that the (you call it blog) site is not a reliable source here, but then find that the links and statements in """"Inertia Coupling"""" or """"Alexander Abian"""" are significant enriching contributions to the users of Wikipedia, and the sourced site is reliable there. BTW, in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned, the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis. It would be highly objectionable from Wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being, and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts, the links will be trashed out. At this point 1) The sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected. 2) It seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote, in most cases some synthesis is involved. 3) There is still the issue of the site being a reliable source. It seems to me that the Wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay, is leading editors to substitute verifiability, intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority. This would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to Wikipedia, once lauded as the place """"to come as you are,"""" becoming stiff, purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding. This in turn carries into a discussion about public education, and the work that Carl Sagan is known to the general public for. Cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so. To me the posts in the disputed site I linked to are interesting (but that maybe just my own personal opinion) and Wikipedia users having them available is positive, constructive and enriching for Wikipedia, and that's the reason I linked to them in the first place. Throwing them out, all of them, seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things, the baby with the bath water, because a Wikipedia directive says so, just because it does, not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening, it would seem to me, not to exclude good things by statute.

I believe wikipedia would be better served by deleting this article, and adding a new sub-section in the races and caucasian articles if it this is not changed to reflect what 99.9% of the people on this earth consider a 'white person' to be, this 99.9% obviously not including alun & slrubenstein.  When it comes down to it, the term 'white person' can't really be defined, it's technically not a race, and any references sited are going to be garbage, as you can find hundreds of them from what could be considered reliable sources that directly defy one another.

I did so last night, and not under a pseudonym as most people have. I always use my real name in signatures.And I don't know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no """"post"""" link.Thanks,Dennis Bathory-Kitszbathory@bathory.orgbathory@maltedmedia.comThanks for your message but I think perhaps my meaning was still unclear.  Whether you register or not doesn't really matter since anyone can register under any name.  I could go online and register a Wikipedia account as George W. Bush (at least, if it's not already taken).  Wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently.  All that we know - all that we can know - is what you choose to claim about yourself.  That's what I meant by pseudonymously - any registration, even if you say that it's your real name, is technically a pseudonym.  It is not independently verified against some external identity database.  And for the most part, that works out very well on Wikipedia.  We want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits, not by making claims to outside credentials.By the way, anyone could also register as Dennis Bathory-Kitzs.  That trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system.  Such a person could sign their name the same way you do, attempt to mimic your pattern of speech (well, writing really) and make subtle edits just to discredit you.  That, in fact, is a real problem for established editors of Wikipedia.  When we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users, we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit.  Users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from Wikipedia.  But those are all manual checks.  There is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it.Likewise, no one can inherently trust the email address.  The way internet domains are set up, anyone could register bathory.org and create any email name they wanted.  Like Wikipedia accounts, emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority.  And that's before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery - both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit.Most people are honest.  But there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it doesn't matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not.  That's why Wikipedia has a policy against original research (which we mean as """"a contribution or assertion based on personal experience"""") and why we never rely solely on self-published materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large, well-known organizations - organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing.Sorry to bore you with all this but my non-Wikipedia profession is information security.  The inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours.  How can a bank know that you're really you?  And how far can that trust be extended?  Under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable?  How do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible.  Unfortunately, there are no easy answers short of establishing a national identity database - something which would be in great tension with my role as a privacy advocate.  Anyway, I'll get off my soapbox now.  Thanks for your message.To post to my Talk page, just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on Wikipedia.  The most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the """"edit this page"""" tab at the top.  That will automatically create a new section and give you a line to create a section header without having to know the wiki-markup symbols.  You should also get in the habit of signing your posts on Talk pages.  You can do that easily by ending your comment with four tildes (~~~~).

Thus, we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of Langan's assertions receive a separate citation, when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article. It is important for Byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents. Not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article, but given that the article already links to ample source material, anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false, irrelevant, or non-neutral. Unfortunately, he hasn't yet been able to lock onto this signal. He still labors under the assumption that like some sort of Ultimate Bureaucrat, he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself.  By now, everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization: neither Byrgenwulf, nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates, HAS any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations. They are merely using the article, which is faithful to the material it cites, to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic, the CTMU, which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks. They do not like what the CTMU says; the article on the CTMU reports on what the CTMU says, and what Langan and the press say about the CTMU; hence, they do not like the article on the CTMU. This conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in Byrgenwulf's transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article, attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger. Meanwhile, he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of Wikipedia verifiability policy, and that his all-too-evident editorial bias is in massive violation of NPOV as well. Oozing contempt, Byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the CTMU article with a load of summary demands, snide remarks, and self-righteous, factually worthless criticism...but not one relevant citation in hand! Nothing he says is verifiable; as we have now repeatedly seen, he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert. This makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to take his demands seriously.         """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hope I get this format right. - WP:BLPGOSSIP states that Be wary of sources that use weasel words and that attribute material to anonymous sources. I am not aware of any weasel words or attribution to anonymous sources. I am not sure how the section applies, if you could be more clear it would be helpful. - The phrase involve claims about third parties is so vague as to not be any assistance. By this metric, so little can be used that it's almost meaningless. Someone stating their birthdate, or the grade school they attended. But for a person saying """"I have a conflict with Jenny Smith over Issue X"""" - where do we draw the line? It could easily be said that an actor and actress divorcing, with one placing on their personal (publicist) website a statement about """"separating for reasons of X"""" is a """"claim about third parties"""", but I wouldn't argue it is unreliable nor unencyclopedic to include in the biography of either individual.

On top of that South Ossetians & Abkahzians are Russian citizens so this would mean that they are in fact part of the Russian Federation.

Nothing buried in the present can be a fossil, for it is in historic time.  And further, you do not quickly bury fossils to preserve them, you quickly bury organic remains to protected them long enough so they they can eventually become fossils in some future geologic era.W&M; likely used the term fossil loosely, like many editors of this WP page, to refer to organic remains that might become fossils per definition in some geologic era in the future.  It is unfortunate that W&M; were not as precise as they might have been, because uninformed people, such as Talk.Origins, misunderstand and twist what they said.As much impact as W&M; have had on Creationary thought, nearly all fellow creationist today recognize that The Genesis Flood, is now way out of date.

One need look no further than my user page where I quote Chris Hedges: """"They control our systems of information."""" and add: Surely no one could be so naive as to believe that corporations do not have an interest in turning our encyclopedia into a corporate-approved encyclopedia.  At a certain point one must admit that to not fight the creep of corporate control into our articles really does make us appear to be a bunch of easily-led, lame-brained, losers just willing to go along with the flow rather than to tackle the problem and try to come up with some sort of strategy.  What, if anything, is presently being done?  I'm aware that a few years ago an editor asked for some sort of outside check to """"prove"""" that he had no COI related to the articles he edits, and I've heard of this incident dozens of times since, where it is raised as absolute evidence of a lack of conflict of interest.  Many times I've wondered how Wikipedia went about finding this so-called proof. If I put myself in a position in which I was editing for pay but denied it, how could it be proven that I was?  I mention this because the first thing you know all a paid editor need do is have WP give him/her the WP Stamp of Approval and from then on that editor is home free to do as they please.

Unfortunately, Wikipedia's use is exactly like the commercial use for commercial news photography. As the template you used states: """"Use of historic images from press agencies must only be used in a transformative nature, when the image itself is the subject of commentary rather than the event it depicts"""".  It's intended for images which are themselves iconic works of art so that we can use the images to primarily facilitate discussion of the image. Even ignoring the legal problems with using the news photography: Wikipedia has a hard requirement for freely licensed images because non-free media compromises the freely licensed status of Wikipedia. Refer to the first rule at WP:NFCC; non-free images are not to be used unless obtaining a freely licensed could not be reasonably believed to be possible. There were undoubtedly thousands of photographs of this balloon taken by amateurs and professionals alike, almost any would do for the purposes of the article. Wikinews claims that the balloon was low-flying and that photographs were captured by area residents.  The best way to get an image for the article would be to leave a placeholder in the article requesting that the public submit one. The effectiveness of such a place holder will probably diminish over time as the attention on this incident dies down. I've been checking flickr and other photo sites but have so far come up dry, though sometimes it takes a little while for people to bother uploading their photographs.I hope I haven't given the impression that I do not appropriate your contributions to the article?as I do, especially your efforts to use even and neutral language in the face of a media environment eager to describe the parties unfavourably.

Generally """"x86"""" was used to point all the processors compatible with IA-32 ISA, might or might name themselves with """"86"""", such as Cyrix 5x86, Intel Pentium 4 and so on. AMD64's long mode is devised by AMD rather than Intel, so how can one sort them together. Nowadays software labeled themselves as """"x86"""" are IA-32 compatible software, and use """"x64"""" or """"x86-64"""" differentiating with it. So this article confuses reader getting in touch with this word. 2. Generations? What is the 8th generation x86 processor? Who invented this kinda processors? AMD K8 just says that it succeeds AMD K7 rather than saying it is the 8th x86 processor, and I've never heard Intel call their x86 processors exceeding the 7th generation. And one thing should never be denied, the first generation of Itanium processor says its family model number as 7, which might potentially imply that Itanium might be the 7th x86 processor succeeding Pentium III, but none confirmed this. So take turn back the Transmeta's Crusoe and Efficeon, if the morph firmed on the system board implements x86 decoder call themselves as x86 processors, then if put the same processor on another board implementing PowerPC decoder, then it would be the PowerPC processor? At this situation, what kind of processor is it? Ridiculous! What's more for what sort it as the 7th/8th generation x86? Who is another Jane Austen, making up another Northanger Abbey?3.

0623b1a8deb81d78,"(undent) This was previously discussed quite a bit at this talk page.  See Archive 9.  The consensus was that Hagee is covered adequately in John McCain presidential campaign, 2008. Hagee gets a couple paragraphs in that article.  The relationship (if one can call it that) between Hagee and McCain was much more remote and brief than that between Obama and Wright.  Many elections nowadays feature guilt-by-association games, but Obama-Wright-TUCC is a bit different, because the coverage went on so long during the campaign, and the relationship went on so long in real life.  If Hagee turns out to bedevil McCain as much as Wright and TUCC has affected Obama, it would merit inclusion here in this main McCain article.  There are hundreds of other items in the sub-articles also. Picking out just Hagee to add to this main article, and not picking out those other hundreds of items, would cause undue weight. This article is about McCain's whole life, not just the current campaign, and in the context of his whole life Hagee is just not very significant. If a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election, then the person can go to the article about McCain's 2008 campaign (which has a couple paragraphs about Hagee). In writing this article, dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are, and those that aren't quite as important don't make the cut.  Right now, some of us think it would be more appropriate to add more about his Vietnam service before the shoot-down, or more on McCain-Feingold, or more on his relations with the Republican Party in the early 2000s, as compared to more about Hagee.",0,0,0,0,0,0

0625a9a8d601235c,"""Alex, thank you for your reply.I could indeed use a break from this case, but yesterday was a very eventful day, as the case closed and then AGK answered a question I'd initially posed on August 22, meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against during the brief window during which I had a chance to respond to the FoF, and then when it made the response, it not only confirmed the """"judgment on content"""" aspect of the FoF, if begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with Arzel in which Arzel not only ignores the content of academically published RS, he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the Formisano text, for example, had been under direct discussion.Regarding the perceived legal threat, I had no intention to make a legal threat. That was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case, starting with NewYorkBrad's comment on my FoF on August 23, to which AGK refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday, more than two weeks later. There were also email exchanges between myself and NYB and AGK, which I will have to forward to Jimbo Wales at some point, after clarifying one point made by NYB on his talk page.The import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as I make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that AGK aspires to become an attorney (or whatever they're called in Scotland). It is secondly an indication that I have taken the time to register at Wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments I had made about """"the court of public opinion"""". And when did a little looking around there, finding an entry about NYB, for example, who had advised AGK that he didn't see any misconduct in some of the points of the FoF, so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney. If the reiteration of material deleted by AGK from his User page within the past two weeks is """"outing"""", then that is a policy I shall have to examine. Note that I am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue.There's much more to say on this, but I need to get a couple more hours of sleep. I have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at Jimbo's talk page, but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation, not even contrasting the complete lack of an FoF on Arzel, for instance, with the response provided to me on the PD talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday.If this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions, and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished, I would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system.  ?? ?????

0651104ccfe11df5,"""Kenneth Tennyson's reckless behavior in other forums==As far as Kenneth Tennyson bashing other authors, here is an exerpt from a book review on Amazon.com:Founder of the homemade Mushindo Karate movement, never studied under a legitimate teacher, or any martial art teacher, never set foot in Asia, completely disproven, shown to have plagiarized many photos and other materials from other published written sources. Of course he claims to have studied under masters in Tibet, and been a disciple of Okinawan Karate teachers - since disproven by such worthy sources as Gorge Mattson, et al. Was involved in an abusive sex scandal with several female students a few years back (""""Sleep with me and I'll enlighten you"""" kinda thing), uses abusive and coercive tactics to control what ex-students say at him, a propaganda liemaster. The person he is bashing is none other than Terrence Dukes (or the real Frank Dukes from the movie Bloodsport)While putting others down, Kenny brags, or advertises about his martial arts expertise to scare people:Hmmm... well, kalaripayattu has a lot of similarities with caopera, alot of jumping and posturing, and a lot of religious themes to it. I guess it depends on what martial arts you've trained in to determine whether I can kick A$$ or not. let's see... I'm a red belt second degree in tae kwon do and have some knowledge in shotoken. I've got to start learning about grappling though. Freedom skies and myself are not the only ones who feel that Kenny is a racist. Here are some excerpts from users from other forums:(The Armchair Analyst - Asia Times Forum)I see. However, you sounded like a racist.No, I have no """"South Asian sensitivities"""". I am no nationalist/jingoist. I consider myself above it all. ALL your posts are based on the rather silly assumption that militaristic power in the last three centuries is a sign of """"greatness"""". It may be in a narrow Anglo-saxon way, but not in a Gandhi-Buddha sort of a way. Get it?Civilizations such as India (actually even China until today) have NEVER had a negative impact on other civilizations that remotely matches yours.You have generalized Indians to be bigots etc., I agree that SOME not all are. But the fact that you generalized it to include an entire ethnic group as """"obnoxious"""", by definition makes you a racist. YES IT DOES! (rocky - Asia Times Forum)What inaccuracy are you referring to? If Brits came to India and got rich, was the wealth Indian or British? Besides looting, what exactly did British accomplish? While your bias is clearly visible with this statement, what is your purpose of posting this in this forum?Isnt it quiet evident that even in yr 2005, it is difficult for you to get off your pompus ass, why on earth would anything written by Anglo-Saxon when Europeans were busy colonizing the world accurate? Isnt there a vested interest on part of the European to disparage Native Cultures and delibrately belittle their achievements? That's just a couple of the many others. However, I do not want to clog up this page.I have also noticed that Kenny tends to have a habit of cutting and pasting articles, and also cloning the article he had fabricated on a few web sites  I know that I am not the only one who knows this:'(Brahman - Martial Arts Planet Forum)i really do hate to post on this topic seems as it was only to counter mine, which by the way it would be nice if you would simply post this on my topic were you could get a real discusion, were as here people might simply ignore you becuase of the topic cloning. (Bliss - Asia Times Forum)Thats not from a 'social studies journal' you fraud, thats a copy paste... (rocky - Asia Times Forum)I believe Kenneth probably picked up a web-site of some Tourist Board",0,0,0,0,0,0

06573ec80185634b,"""Hmmm. I was actually writing a response as you sent yours. Oh well. For the record, my response was this:Resurrecting articles is frowned upon, yes. We might be able to get away with it if the article we resurrect is a substantial improvement on the last one, however - though of course we both know that there's no guarantee it would ultimately be accepted whatever we did - there is an established bias towards deleting articles on individual matches. Changing the name would be nice but I'm not sure what we would change to...the game didn't really have a """"name"""" like the Ballet on Ice or any such, and there are limited other ways of naming the article.Making this subpage was a decent idea, you just got unlucky in that it's something that has already been tried elsewhere and ultimately voted against. Honestly I can say I've never seen a subpage for an actual mainspace article so I have no idea how much people tend to chase these articles up or whether it might just glean a community-wide shrugging of the shoulders. Certainly there's been no AfD nomination yet, which is a start. I have to say I somewhat favour making it a standalone article or merging with the season article (i.e. not keeping the subpage) but I don't have strong feelings so I'll run with whatever works. If it got categorised it would either be put into a category for something like Category:Football matches (I have no idea if that exists, it was another example) and Category:FA Cup and then probably into a new category for City matches or comebacks or somesuch where it probably would be on its own. That category would then have to be categorised so it wasn't just an orphan. I don't know what the ethic is here for creating categories with only a single article in them but I suspect it's not encouraged, so that idea might be rejected if (whoever did it) couldn't find more like-minded articles to categorise into the same. I don't think it being categorised would really affect anyone's opinion of the article though. The one thing that might affect peoples' judgement right now is that it will (in its present form) show up in categories as """"2003?4 Manchester City F.C. season/Spurs 3-4 City"""" or however the subpage is actually named, given the / in the name.Yes, I'd say it will currently be located in an overarching """"please categorise these pages"""" category. I don't know how long it would take for it to get sorted, but it would probably be put somewhere generic. Better to do it ourselves, I guess.Sorry my thoughts were a bit disjointed but I was answering the points as they came and...well, better English just didn't quite flow from my fingers as I typed. Hopefully I addressed all your points. I'll settle for just keeping the subpage if you want it, though I think that page would be best served by being redone - with as many citations as possible - and expanded upon, so we can argue a case for it being reincluded into society, so to speak. Having an article AfD'ed isn't a permanent sign that that article should never exist, it's merely a suggestion that it shouldn't exist in the state it's in. Generally speaking most articles that get deleted will be kept the second time around if their quality and/or level of detail is substantially improved.As for the Charity Shield, I always considered it a notable trophy. Yes, it's a single game, but it requires winning a trophy to qualify in the first place (ignoring those early years when some teams refused to play). To this end, I'd consider it more of an accomplishment than winning the trophy which qualified you for it. Similarly, would you question the worthiness of the European Super Cup? In fact, because some teams initially didn't enter, City were instrumental in making the Charity Shield the respected competition it is today by taking their place in the competition twice. You could argue that of all the teams to have ever played in it, we should be the ones most ardently defending it.  Talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

""""At-bat"""" just redirects right back to at bat anyway. -  I agree.  I agree because he is correct that it should not be hyphenated.  In addition, pls stop edit warring at Matt Joyce (baseball), Ian Kinsler, Craig Breslow, etc.  And add to the list Matt Guerrier.  It is perfectly accurate and reasonable to reflect his won lost record.  There is no reason to delete it, other than your penchant for disruptive edits.  Kindly desist.  It has also been explained to you, with proper citations, that the plural of RBI is RBIs.  Pls stop edit warring this point.  See Juan Encarnaci?n and Terry Tiffee.  That is vandalism.  Run batted in says: """"The term may be pluralized as either RBI or RBIs"""". Obviously not vandalism then but a difference in opinion then.@Matt Guerrier, the reason it didn't show up was because a """"|"""" was missing, and with your edit you re-removed it and duplicated info.It's amazing how you continue to assume bad faith, blindly reverting and editwarring over messages on his own talk page... ?t??) Danged if this little war isn't over some seriously picayune crap. Both sides are being a bit petty here, because really either set of edits is acceptable on these pages (well, except for the bolded Contract on Ian Kinsler  either make it a subhed or take it off, seriously).Oh, and technically, the plural of RBI is RsBI, but that just looks clunky. In common usage, """"RBI"""" is used for either singular """"Run Batted In"""" or plural """"Runs Batted In"""". """"RBIs"""" is a bastardization used only because it's simpler from a usage standpoint.Either way, I think everyone involved in this should chill out for a few days and just leave all these pages alone. -  Jackal4, again, is making a rash of these edits on every page I touch.  As to RBIs, as X96lee15 pointed out the most thorough treatment is at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Baseball/Archive_5#RBIs.  Plus, mlb.com is the official reporter of baseball, and uses the RBIs convention.  Yet, Jackal4's reaction to that is to go on pages where I have written it thus, to delete the s  as though the s is incorrect.  He has done the same with """"at bat""""  which he insists must be hyphenated.  Etcetera .... these are just two of the types of reverts he feels impelled to make of my edits.  It is picayune, but it is wrong to revert perfectly good edits.  If he insisted on lower-casing RBIs, or any similar degradation, I would think it wrong of him to follow people around and revert perfectly good edits.  There is enough good work he could perform instead.   Well, I can't stop him from wasting time if that's what he wants to do ) . As for """"thorough treatment"""", I'm not sure I consider a bit to which a grand total of two people contributed particularly thorough. I respect Kingturtle, but I think he's got it wrong on this one. Regarding what mlb.com uses, you're appealing to the wrong authority, because it's not a terminology issue, it's a grammar issue. In any case, at this point I have no doubt that these edits are being reverted simply because you're both watching for each other's names on your watchlists. Allow me to again encourage the both of you to just stay away from each other's edits entirely for a while and allow the bad feelings to ebb. At the rate you're going, you're both going to get blocked. -  Jargon overrides grammar.

Some enthusiasts removed the word arguably when citing the source.  Let's have a look at the law itself.  Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia Official Press Release Certain forms of conduct as outlined below, which are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose, are punishable as criminal offences: ... public condoning, denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide ... as defined in the Statute of the International Criminal Court (Articles 6, 7 and 8) and crimes defined in Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group. Example: Somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide, the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court, never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments. This allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned, but would also incite hatred against this group. In the future, all Member States would be compelled to criminalise such a case. Whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. In the case of the Holocaust, for example, this was done by the Nuremberg Tribunal. As we see, the law is restricted to cases, when: the commission of genocide is established by an international court and the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatredIs the commission of Armenian genocide established by an international court?

The Police Report is DR#071828895.LAUSD personnel, specifically, Steven Thomas Rooney, aided and abetted violations of the Ralph and Bane Civil Rights Acts, Sections 51.7, 52 and 52.1 of the California Civil Code and Sections 242, 245, and 422.6 of the California Penal Code, by failing and refusing to report the matter to police authorities.

I have suffered physical damages and extreme emotional trauma as a result.David Brewer and other personnel knew or should have known based upon my complaints and upon past known misconduct by Rooney that Rooney was unfit as a supervisory employee of LAUSD.  LAUSD therefore negligently hired, trained, assigned, supervised and retained Rooney and ignored my complaints about his misconduct.LAUSD黶 conduct towards me is motivated by benign neglect of complaints of discrimination, retaliation, and harassment by Latino employees, as exemplified in past incidents by Superintendent Brewer and the General Counsel黶 office failing to properly investigate and take appropriate action when complaints were levelled against anti-Hispanic ethnocentric misconduct against an attorney employed by the Office of the General Counsel, and other incidents.Pursuant to Section 910(f) this claim is for damages within the jurisdiction of the unlimited division of the Los Angeles Superior Court.Respectfully Submitted,Migdia Chineacc:  California LULAC Civil Rights Commission, United For Education Coalition",0,0,0,0,0,0

It does not prescribe that Arvanitic is a language or a dialect and as it has been pointed out, the reader can review all the evidence for himself/herself and see what he/she thinks. Wikipedia should not take sides and especially Wikipedia should not say that UNESCO, Britannica etc aree wrong. Macedonian and Luxembourgish etc CAN be treated as languages because all neutral credible sources say they are (while the same sources say that Arvanitic is a dialect). If Britannica or UNESCO etc said that they were dialects, then they could be treated as such. No neutral source formally aknowledges that they are dialects. Why should they be treated as such. Every neutral source says that Arvanitic is a dialect and therefore should be treated as such and the word language should not be in the title. We can discuss possibilities of it being a language in the text, but NOT in the title. Arvanitic is neutral and will be used as it has received he majority support. Possibilities of Arvanitic being a language in its own right can be discussed in the article, NOT in the title as that would be a violation of Wikipedia's policies.

She is of the firm, resolute belief that this version of my own talk page amounts to """"soapboxing"""" and has deleted it.  I recognize that there may be elements of soapboxing in the """"investment predictions for 2008"""" section at the bottom of the page, but have given her the opportunity to amend rather than delete the whole section.  She has declined the opportunity to amend, leaving me in the difficult position of having to type this with a knife pressed ever-so-gently against my back, with Coren carefully looking over my shoulder at the screen to check whether anything is, in her God-like view, """"soap-like"""".  Not the most pleasant position to be in, I can assure you.To use another example, picked completely at random: Let's say there's been a nasty and vicious and ugly and persistent edit war over, say, fractional reserve banking, and a number of editors want a messy but more informative version like this one kept in.  Then let's say I post this earlier version on my talk page for readers to compare with the now in-my-humble-view slaughtered version.  Is that """"soapboxing""""??To use another example, closer to home.  Let's say a guy like Zenwhat says to his co-conspirators, """"What can we do to have OUR version of debt-based monetary system/fractional reserve banking prevail?"""", like he clearly said here under the (desperate?) heading """"Heeeeelp"""".  And then he also (bizarrely?) asks Gregalton help him delete references to Mises.org like he did here, saying to Gregalton: """"Also, in case you're interested, one of the easiest ways to find economics articles that have been vandalized is to do a search for links to Mises.org""""As if a reference to the great Ludwig von Mises amounted to VANDALISM? Can you BELIEVE IT?  I have to hold a pencil between my teeth just to keep control of myself and keep typing this.  The guy is clearly a vicious tiny weeny little troll.  He also says to his co-conspirator the following, on the same page: """"I looked at the fractional reserve banking article recently and saw how it was so horribly vandalized. It made me realize that we're going around in circles. We improve the articles to the point that they look great. Then they get screwed up again. So, I had an idea: Would you be interested in helping me write an essay on """"Monetary Crankery""""? It could help people who AREN'T educated...The idea is for it to be straightforward, with references, but polemic and satirical of monetary crankery.""""Clearly this guy is obsessed with deleting or """"satirizing"""" any positions on monetary theory that don't agree with his.  (The guy is mad.  If the guy had napalm or nukes he'd use them without hesitation.)   Then, for good measure, he goes back to debt-based monetary system to do more """"editing"""".  Zenwhat is clearly a piece of work.  Check out the dude's talk page.  In addition to his obsessive interest in deleting anything associated with Mises.org, his main interests appear to be something called """"cannabis culture"""" and """"the Buddhist connection with marijuana"""".  So, I gather from this that his main """"interests"""" are monetary theory and dope smoking.  What a combo!Seeing this, I ponder my options.  I decide to post a note here, ON MY OWN TALK PAGE, asking readers to compare older (better?) versions of some important articles on monetary theory with the current versions.  For good measure I offer my predictions on the financial markets for 2008 as a gift to the (eight?) people persistent enough to read my humble little talk page.  It immediately gets deleted by all-seeing, all-knowing Coren as """"soapboxing"""".  Is this strict compliance with WP guidelines or a WP-style Fascist Dictatorship where people like Coren delete at will, but don't bother to make CONSTRUCTIVE suggestions as to how what I have written CAN come within the guidelines?    This is like watching evolution in reverse.  I carefully construct a page with the help of others.

Your edits are predominantly changes to lead images, yet you almost never leave an edit summary explaining them. You also reverted my change without even knowing what """"contemporary"""" means or whether a certain image was contemporary with the subject or not. The reasons to prefer the coin are:it is a contemporary artefact, giving information about Peter's reign (w/ a caption) and about how he was seen by his subjects in his lifetimethe coin does not mislead readers about the times of Peter III, as the portrait mightthe silver coin on a white background is more striking than the somewhat garish portrait in low-resolution JPG formatit is far more likely that the limited detail of the coin is accurate (clean shaven and long-haired) than the greater detail of the imaginary portraitthe later portrait is one of a series of nearly indistinguishable royal portraits from two centuries later, it gives us no information about Peter or his reign, its sole purpose was decorativewhat makes the coin an image of Peter is that that is when it was struck and what for, but what makes the later portrait an image of Peter is that somebody labelled it that way黷hey could just as easily have labelled an image of any other Aragonese kingIn your last edit summary, you ask """"if I have to choose between two unreal representations, I prefer the portrait"""", but nobody is asking you to choose or what you prefer.   Srnec, the problem is that we have different criteria.You think the images should provide information about the lives of the persons and be of the age in which these people lived. I think the only thing to do is to give a visual representation of the person, the article is to the information.I think that a portrait (even if wasn't painted during the live of the person) is most valid that a little image carved in a coin. The two representations have the same chance of not being 100% accurate, but at least one illustrates better than the other.If not exist any portrait of this person, then I accept a coin's image or a poor drawing. But the present picture accomplish the role and I think that it must be more time.  I already argued why the coin is a better illustration and you've just asserted the contrary. Do you have an argument? Why are your criteria better than mine?   Really? When I rebutted all your arguments in your talk page, I stated my reasons. But I do not want another long discussion with you. I offer consensus. Would you take a picture of the first part of the thirteenth century?  Both of those are improvements over the 17th-century image, but not over the coin. At least one other editor agrees with me.   Sorry I'm not agree with your second comment, but I hope we have made a step in the right direction. This discussion is already too long. Both images are the best ones that meet your rigid standard of closeness to the character's life. Either both seem right.   Imposing your personal preference is not how it occurs on Wikipedia I noticed in the message above that this is not the first time that you try to impose pictures on articles regardless of what others think.

I thought his testimony confirmed that he was part of the camp's management team.  But, if the camp had been a college I think his role(s) would be closest to that of the college registrar and placement officer.  A registrar confirms that applicants grades are in order, and officially informs them that they have been admitted.  AZ ran houses where he formed an assessment as to whether applicants were good candidates for training.  And, once they finished their training, he helped those who wanted to go fight in Chechnya or Israel to slip into those conflict zones.  He had helped grads slip into Bosnia, during the civil war there.  I think it would have been more accurate to say Ibn al Shaykh al Libi ran the camp.  His location was a secret for four years.  He was found in a Libyan prinson in April, by human rights workers, who conducted an initial interview with him.  And a few weeks later the Libyans reported he committed suicide.

It is an election to decide which persons are to be members of that important committee.We must discuss the editors who are to become members of the committee.We cannot question articles about their content, nor can we ask the content questions, but we can ask the proposed contents of the ArbCom questions.Is a certain level of intellectual ability pertinent to ArbCom membership? If you do not think so, how many of the present ArbCom do you consider stupid? Would a low intellect on ArbCom helpp or hinder? If there is evidence (a diff) of intellectual failings, does the candidate realise this failing? Can he explain it as something other than an intellectual failing? The questions were politely put. They were challenging, and they were meant to be, and anyone in the community (which includes me) has the right to ask candidates challenging questions on their past performance. There was no name calling, all questions were relevant to a quality of the candidate pertinent to his ability to perform on ArbCom. They were not deferential.

Google this: """"statistical divisions"""" site:un.org The term """"statistical divisions""""(plural form) can ALSO mean any organization bodies who are doing statisitcal work in governments.  Google this: """"statistical divisions"""" site:un.orgTherefore, it is not advisable to use the ambigous general term """"statistical divisions"""", or the wrong organization term  """"Statistics Division"""" to refer to UN M.49 . UN statistical divisions can refer to any agencies doing statisitcal work under the UN system, or imply that there are certain UN statistical categorization schemes in a general sense (not geographical). I agree that UN geoscheme is widely used for stastitcs and ALSO mapping. Natural Earth has region_un and subregion metadata for each country. I use it quiet often. It is why I notice that most of academic work refer this geographic categorization/classification scheme as """"UN geoscheme"""". Try Google BOOK search and you will find at least the following:""""The best option to identify the states from Asia could be use the United Nations (UN) geoscheme for Asia.

By the name FC Citizens( Vardar ) the club won 4 championships from 1936 till 1939. About Yugoslavia, you have to know that Yugoslavia was a federation of 6 Republics -countries together and each Republic had its own championship, and there was a Federal League where teams from the Republics competed together. Each Republic had its own Cup and the cup winners competed in the Marshals Cup, that cup was held in honor of Joseph Broz the marshal of the Federation, and its was called the Cup of the Marshal. How ever FC Vardar never won the Federal league ( League made of Federation of 6 Republics best teams ,thats why its called the Federal League, and not Yugoslavian League nor Yugoslavian Cup). The title in 1987 was won by FC Partizan Belgrade , you can check in any official statistics or documents. The second federal league was made of two Second Federal Leagues , East ( 3 Republics competed, Serbia ,Monte Negro,Macedonia and two Provinces- almost the same as Republics but yet without a nation ,those were Kosovo and Vojvodinship ) and West ( 3 Republics, Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia, sometimes clubs from province Vojvodinship  would compete in the West depending on the federation decisions ). In the period of 1922 till 1929, present day Republic of Macedonia was established as 4 provinces within the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes, those 4 provinces were Skopje, Bitola,Shtip and Vranje prvinces. These 4 provinces established the Macedonian Football Federation in 1926,and they held 3 championships. In 1929 these 4 provinces joined in one Duchy and this championship was held in the Duchy ( Banovina ) for 11 times.During the WW2 the championship was held under German Occupation, and the German government recognized this League. After the WW2 the very same championship was tranformed in to Republic Football League ,just the Province of Vranje was separated from the Republic as Macedonia transformed from Duchy to a Republic and the province of Vranje was under the newly made Republic of Serbia in 1946. The bottom line is since the Federation of 6 Republics split in the 90s, Macedonian Republic League was transformed in to Macedonian First League. So it is the same League that changed names and competition format during the decades, and now it came to this Level. Its a petty that there is lots of politics and territorial pretensions lots of denial of the existence of the Macedonia and other Republics in the Federation , by the Serbian side. Serbian official politic is to show that Yugoslavia was one country and nation mainly based on Serb character and they are stilling all the history including history of sports in this case football. They are trying to show the world that there was Yugoslav nation ( Serb ) and only Yugoslav Football league ( Serb League ) denying the Federal League second Federal League and Republic Leagues. They want to show only Yugoslav League and not the real Federal League. They hold all the champions from the Federal League as Serbian Champions in every competition. For FC Vardar at this point of view considering that  Macedonia is not in the Federetion for more than 20 years,and it wont be in the future ,the most important are the titles and trophies won in the Macedonian League , and if you wont to put additional trophies won in the Federation ,the period before 1991 you should write the precise information. Second Federal League East is the name of the competition, and you should put the Macedonian Flag from that period of the time next to it,instead of the federal flag, simply because that federation dont exist anymore and doesnt represent any country nor nation. About the cup , you should write down the real proper name as it was called ,Marshals Cup also fallowed by Macedonian flag from that period of the time, you should put a notice that in the Federal Second League East , clubs from Serbia Macedonia and Monte Negro competed including the provinces of Kosovo i Vojvodinship.",0,0,0,0,0,0

085f6057d37d6b45,"""Hello Barto. I am curious as to what your motivation is in editing on the Ron Gostick page and are you the creator of it?  As stated on the talk page there, you are correct in stating that internet sources which are few come from mostly the extreme right or left.  These are terms both I and Ron, himself would acknowledge as being artificially misleading characterisations and could not be ascribed to him or the associates of the Canadian League of Rights. I could explain why here, but I won't bore you with the details.However, I do reject the notion that everything must link to a Wiki article.  I am editing at another page, where there is no objection to verifiable external sourcesinternet or hard copy. I will not object to so-called Left or Right sources, as long as there are sources from external links to associations and people connected to Mr. Gostick.  The archives at the Australian League of Rights will have plenty of published materials on him, League objectives and views or anyone associated with him. This is one link that was removed in favor of David Lethbridge's document (hardly a non-politcally unbiased character considering he represents everything the opposite of what Gostick and the League of Rights stood for).I will try to help you find sources, fair and credible in the near future, doing edits myself.  I just want to know if you have a bias of your own or are willing to be neutral on some claims made about him.  I know well what he and the League of Rights stand for, as I have been involved with it for near 30 yrs. There is no denying he was anti-totalitarianism and that includes anti-zionist, which automatically brings down the bogus smear of """"anti-semitism' and other such nonsense.  An editor should have at least some familiarity with the subject he is decidedly determined to write about.I have notified Paul Fromm of the wiki page and link to him at Gostick's page, in case he didn't know it existed.  Be aware that Wikipedia has come under criticism for pages created on living persons, edited by vandals with damaging false claims unknown to the subject of the article until much later.  One was a recent high-level member of the Kennedy administration and believe me he made a public stink about it.

089245a77385ff8a,"""(deindent) Sorry for kibitzing, but I wanted to be fair to all points of view, even those of the dualists. so I tried to stick to presenting the thought experiments without drawing conclusions.The thought experiment is this: you have one observer The observer gets cloned into copy 1 and copy 2 (either Hubert/Yorick or star-trek style) The copies diverge, either because of internal noise, or because of the environmentFrom a third person point of view, this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system, there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on- one observer becomes two. If probed, each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event. But viewed from the inside, if you are the observer getting cloned, there is a very natural question you can ask: Am I going to end up being copy 1 or am I going to be copy 2? This question cannot even be formulated from the outside, so it has no objective answer, but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer.This scenario is Dennett's (and to some extent Everett's). Since the question doesn't even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective, the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms. You might conclude that this question doesn't make any sense. But, in any case, the answer to this question is 1 bit of subjective information which both copy 1 and copy 2 know, and which the original observer does not. In the objective third person view, there is no information gained- you know that copy 1 will say """"I am copy 1"""" and copy 2 will say """"I am copy 2"""".To give an example of actual OR and SYNTH, I'll go beyond Dennett's example: suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely, so that the cloning keeps happening again and again. Then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer, from the first person perspective. For example, take a star-trek duplicator, and duplicate the observer, and then duplicate each duplicate, but add a twist: the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks, and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later, and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way. And then it does so again forty years later, then sixty years later. What is the subjective experience? From a naive counting perspective, I should predict that I would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point, because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies. On the other hand, the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates. So perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice, rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state. Even worse, how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator? (Boltzmann's brain is a similar idea).

08c0a7aa45ea3f0e,""" Dubious claims about clearly non-transgenderd people This article lists a whole bunch of people whos transgender status is clearly wrong and others for whom it is highly speculative.  This isn't a list of people who """"kinda, sorta, there's a small chance, maybe"""" are transgender.The ones who cross-dressed for some nefarious/deceptive purpose and not as a life style choice clearly can not be classified as transgender and should be removed from the article completely.  The fact that mythological figures such as Achilles were even added in the first place says a lot about the POV pushing of the people who supported it.  The only mythological one who might be considered transgenderes is Guan Yin.  The real life figures who did it to disguise themselves to avoid something (e.g. military service) or even to get into something where women are discriminated against.  They did it for deceptive purposes as well, so they can't really be considered transgendered.The pope one is laughable and definitely should be removed.  The one about Joan of Arc is based exclusively on an accustion from a unreliable source.  If they accused her of being a witch, should we have included her in a list of witches too?  Also, I'd like to see an authoritative source showing that she was even accused of it as it seems that it's most Wikipedia ripped sites and LGBT websites that site that as fact.And what are """"transvestite tendencies"""" in reference to Ed Wood?  You need to start citing sources or I'm just going to start deleting them.  That goes mainly for the historical and mythological figurse section.Maxwell Klinger wasn't even a real transvestite, he only did that so he'd get a section 8 and get kicked out of the army.  Anyone who watched the show knows he would try all kinds of crazy stuff to get kicked out under the guise of being mentally ill.  This phrase describing the character is also very odd: """"Although a transvestite, he loudly denied any charges of homosexuality.""""  What's the association between the two?Also, it appears they're using a warped definition of transgender here.  I've never heard a definition that would automatically include cross-dressers as if that automatically means they identify with the opposite gender rather than just enjoying the clothes.  I'm sorry, but this overly broad and incorrect definition of transgender is obviously an attempt just to make the list as long as possible. 28 June 2005 21:00 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

As this article's creator and main editor, I'm sorry that you thought the review section was so negative.  Please understand that it was not my intention to present it that way or that I was in any way trying to disparage your book.  In my rush to get the article published, I did a google search and those are the reviews I found.  Also please understand that this is a Wikipedia article, and the article as it now stands will never be """"complete"""".  It's a work in progress.  I thought an article about Street Gang was important enough to get out there.  I am by no means a professional writer, so I'm certain there are all kinds of weaknesses about it, so I depend upon the feedback of other more experienced editors.  I would've thought that the other sections of the article demonstrates my respect for you and for your work.  I appreciate your feedback, something I always welcome as a Wikipedia editor.  If you are aware of other sources that I wasn't able to locate, please send them my way, on my talk page.  I'll repeat this message via your webpage, to ensure that you see it.You should also know that I've taken it upon myself to improve all Sesame Street-related articles on Wikipedia.  It's a big project, and a great need.  For example, Sesame Street, at one point was actually a featured article, but it was recently downgraded for some really good reasons.  It's an unfortunate state at the current time.  Your book came out shortly after I took on the project, so it's been a boom for me.  I thought focusing on the history of the show was a natural place to start, so your book has been a valuable resource.  I've already started working on this article: History of Sesame Street, and if you look at the reference section, you'll see that I've used your book extensively.  It's also a work in progess, and no where near finished.  My goal is that at least this article get up to featured article status by Sesame Street's 40th anniversary in November.  I can't tell you how much your book has helped me.On a personal level, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your book.  It was a fun read, and immensely interesting.  I was brought to tears many times, especially when I realized while reading about all that Joan Cooney and her team did to get the show on the air.  See, I'm turning 45 this year, which makes me old enough to be the first audience that watched it.  I had to put the book down to compose myself when I realized, """"They did all that for me!""""  I appreciate learning about the struggles they all went through to affect my life so profoundly, and now the life of my own children, who are severely developmentally disabled and love the show as much as I did and still do.  I believe that Sesame Street deserves high quality articles on Wikipedia, and I've taken it upon myself to help accomplish that.  If you, as the ultimate expert, could assist me in that goal, I can't tell you how valuable that would be.  Again, thanks for the feedback and communication.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

08c9b28b32622dd3,"Jung And Einstein In 1895 Albert Einstein was a pupil at cantonal school in Aarau, Switzerland. In 1896, after school in Switzerland, Einstein renounced his German citizenship. Carl P. Jung was born in in the Swiss canton (or county) of Thurgau. While Jung worked on Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (Psychology of the Unconscious), tensions grew between Freud and Jung. Frank P. Geyer continued to serve as a detective until August 15, 1903 when he resigned. He had been transferred to the 18th Police District in the United States. Detective Geyer had arrested James Anderson; whether this is the same Anderson mentioned in Detective Geyer's 1896 work is non-determinable. In 1912 tensions between the two psychologists came to a peak. In 1901-02 Albert Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship and completed a scientific paper, obtaining a teaching position at school in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. The FBI file on Einstein came to light in 1983 when Robert Alan Schwartz wrote an article on the subject for The Nation magazine. Between J. Edgar Hoover and John Hutchison, democratic rights didn黷 stop with McCarthy黶 downfall nor with the demise of so-called notorious J. Edgar Hoover. Yet for years, zero-point energy according to Hutchison is obtained from the quantum vacuum. Hutchison claims on scientific phenomena are regularly featured and discussed by various media coverage. John Hutchison's claims of inventions and discoveries of a variety of phenomena are, like, NASA. The FBI should do an article on NASA and their non-determinable webers.I do not find it too surprising Schwartz once more wrote about not only Frank Geyer, but Albert Einstein with not too much said about Carl P.

08cb6364a31ea3b4,""" Msa Garratts Hi,The idea about an article is a good one, but unfortunately you've started out with an error. That is understandable as the subject is complex. The WAGR first imported the M class Garratts, in 1911. These are very important locos, because they are the third class of Garratt to be built, and the first """"main line"""" Garratt, showing the potential as a heavy freight hauler. They were followed up in 1912 by the Ms class, only difference being the Ms class were superheated. So they were also the first class of Garratts to be the subject of a repeat order. Both classes were built by Beyer-Peacock.The Msa class were constructed in 1930 by the WAGR in their own workshops. Apparently a copy of the Ms class, they did seem to have some cosmetic differences.The story does not end there, but moves to Victoria. The VR G class apparently is copied from the Ms class, the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge. Outside framed Garratts are very rare, even in the smaller gauges. But wait there is more (no, not steak knives!). The design was used again, for the Australian Portland Cement's 3'6"""" line near Geelong, the first loco being supplied in 1936 and the second in 1939. The boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored G42.So in conclusion the design was constructed over a period of 28 years, used on three railway, on two gauges and built by two manufacturers, with, if I've added it up correctly, 27 locos constructed.Personally I think the article should cover the history of the design, and include all the varients. Some work would be required to hunt down variations, though. So yes, I think it does deserve an article.Please feel free to use the above if you wish.Cheers,Michael.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I am a """"cognitive miser"""" like anyone that takes short cuts when I can, just as you shortened it to M-W.  Rather than grasp at straws in dissecting ones arguments let us focus on the big picture when we know what each other means.  I agree the dictionary isn't for giving an exhaustive description, that's what encyclopedias are for.  However in this instance it does shed some light on """"the controversy"""" as it does indeed define a clip as also a magazine.  The reason for including it is not to give people a better understanding of the differences between types of clips or the different types of magazines.  The purpose of including it is to show the other side of the controversy and according to my research within Wikipedia this is entirely acceptable.  Agreement: Clearly some people don't agree with M-W just as you and I don't agree with SAAMI's statement that people sometimes refer to """"cartridge clips"""" as """"magazines"""".  The """"experts"""" on weapon's have this fact somewhat backwards and are incorrect as they should state that people refer to """"magazines"""" as """"clips"""".  Just because you and I disagree with SAAMI's statement doesn't mean it should be taken out as a reference and I'd never suggest that.What I suggest is a compromise.  I agree with you about the references regarding Remington and Marlin as that does seem to fall under OR.  M-W however doesn't fall under OR as it is a published source and being a leader in its industry it could be argued is the authority on word use.  Do you have any suggestions on how it could be incorporated so as to show how this controversy is perpetuated?  Without saying it's wrong because it clearly isn't according to common usage.  I'm thinking something like this....Clip technically defined.....use to describe magazine is controversial....however M-W defines it as such.This allows readers to see their is a difference in terms, there is a controversy, and why it potentially exists or is perpetuated.  I think this is fair.  Note well that I never attempted to remove any sources that backed up what you're saying here.  I'm not interested in destroying your view, only presenting both sides fairly.

If you like we can say instead official indifference or unresponsiveness, but I don't see how that better informs the reader.I also don't see how your wording makes the point you mention re success in decrypting and the importance of that success. Obviously a request for more resources will try to convince the recipient that such will help the writers to better do what they've been tasked to do. To spell out that their desire was """"to achieve the productivity that was possible"""" would be completely superflous  of course that was the goal.

Your wording doesn't mention any of that stuff anyway.Further (as I've said before) I also don't see why it matters what specific type of resource was lacking  the important points are: (a) the codebreakers felt that they could not do the best job possible without more resources; (b) Churchill unhesitatingly granted them carte blanche, showing the importance he attached to their work and the breadth of his authority in making such decisions. What doesn't matter is just what it was that was lacking  typists? paperclips? light bulbs?Some of these elements could be incorporated to enliven the narrative e.g. some kind of """"for want of a nail""""-type angle  """"Look, Prime Minister, you've gathered all these first-class minds here but we can't get anything done because we have to do our own bloody TYPING!""""  if sources lay something like that out.Am I missing something?

090568b1d4264f0e,"""None: Beefart repliesThanks for you comments. Few take the time to discuss grammar on Wikipedia and it shows in many articles. I disagree with you about 'none'. The word comes from the Old Norse ne an, which means, literally """"no one"""". In my view, to get the sense of any usage of 'none' we must expand it in our minds to """"no one"""". It is impossible to say """"no one are dinosaurs"""". It has to be """"no one is a dinosaur"""". Here are two examples from the OED: (E.J. Howard): Except for her eyes, none of her features was remarkable. (P. Rose): People sought her... but none was a companion. HOWEVER, the plot thickens, because the OED also gives this example from Graham Greene, who is highly regarded as a writer: None of our wives are invited. This flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the OED has given up the fight. Maybe I ought to as well ) ). There are of course some situations where expanding """"none"""" to """"no one"""" does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural. (e.g. None of the increase is due to...). Here the best we can hope for is to propose that """"none"""" is a synonym for """"nothing"""".

090a0d1ebb5d71b8,""" The Truth about the 1986 Sinn Fin Ard Fheis The story of how Gerry Adams tried to turn an eighty year old revolutionary movement into a British Constitutional party.  How he broke the Sinn Fin constitution, created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting.  How he managed to expel himself and his supporters from Sinn Fin membership.  And, how a small band of republicans managed to keep the Sinn Fin constitution and traditional policy in tact. In 1986 Section 1b. of the Sinn Fin constitution read as follows:?o person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 26-County or 6-County  parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership.."""" The Adams leadership put forward a motion, titled Resolution 162, at the 1986 Ard Fheis.  Its wording was as follows: RESOLUTION 162THAT this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:a. Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle.b. Shall not draw their salaries for personal use. (Parliamentary representatives shall be paid a Sinn Fein organiser? subsidy, and the Leinster House salary shall be divided at the direction of the Ard Chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.)To accommodate this change, the Constitution and Rules be amended as follows:That Section 1b of the Constitution be amended to read: No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 6-County parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. Motion 162 supports and approves of the candidature of persons who, if  elected, would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the Ard Chomhairle.  Obviously, Motion 162 infringes Section 1b.  Section 1b. was inn effect at the time this Resolution was presented.  Its clear that Adams made a mistake in procedure.  He should have sought a majority decision to amend Section 1b. in 1986 and returned in 1987 to propose entering Leinster House.  Trying to amend Section 1b. and propose taking seats in the ?artitionist 26-County Parliament?in the same Resolution was a logical impossibility. Can anybody say that  the wording:?hat this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:a.  Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle?does not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle?Clearly Adams was in breach of Section 1b. and according to that section he had expelled himself, and all those who voted for Resolution 162.Brian Feeney, in his book, Sinn Fin 100 Turbulent Years, puts forward the argument that Adams had managed to bypass Section 1b, by introducing a motion in 1983 allowing the ?iscussion?of any aspect of the Sinn Fin constitution.  This change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of Section 1b in any way.  To disco discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it.  For example, conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it.  In fact the line Adams added in 1983 was superfluous, as the Sinn F?in constitution had never banned the 黡iscussion?of anything ?just the 黙pproving?and 黶upporting?of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.Of course its not illegal to amend or remove section 1b. Section 1b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in British assemblies. It can be removed or amended at any Ard Fheis by a two thirds majority. The reason for doing so could be many. Perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the Republic. In fact its not necessary, according to the constitution, to give any reason. But you",0,0,0,0,0,0

092c04fa0489aa72,"Deletion of AV News page Just curious why the AV News page is being deleted while its primary competitor Antelope Valley Press is allowed to have its page here unmolested.Granted we have only been in business for six years but we are every bit as a legitimate news organization as AV Press and even more so than AV Town Crier, whose page is also allowed to be here I note.Here is the content:The AV News began as a weekly print newspaper with emphasis on local news located in Lancaster, California USA. It was the second largest circulating newspaper in the area after it began publishing in 2006. In 2008, the AV News added a website and in March 2010, much like the Seatte Post-Intelligencer, the AV News transitioned to a web-only publication. The AV News covers the Antelope Valley area of Los Angeles County - mainly the Palmdale/Lancaster Urbanized Area (a US Census Bureau defined term) and areas of north Los Angeles and southeastern Kern counties, including Acton, Agua Dulce, Edwards AFB, Lake Los Angeles, Mojave, Quartz Hill, Rosamond and Santa Clarita. The newspaper is conservative in its political stance. It is currently the official news publication of the Lancaster JetHawks, a minor league baseball team in Lancaster.HistoryThe AV News was founded by Fran Paolinelli in 2006. She continues to work at the publication today. It began as a weekly print publication before dropping its print version to become a web only publication at www.avnewsday.comThe paper, conservative leaning, holds strongly held views, which can become controversial at times.Competitors in its market are the Daily News, Antelope Valley Press and the Los Angeles Times.External linksAV News Official WebsiteThe format is the same as the AV Press. There is less historical info that the AV Press because we have only been going for six years and they've been up for decades. But still, we are getting e-mails from people who use Wiki to find out about the Lancaster/Palmdale area and are surprised to find out that there are more newspapers in the area than what they find listed.I also point out that the City of Lancaster is a major advertiser with us as is the local professional baseball team.Please info me as to what more I need to include so that our page will be left on site or restore the page.",0,0,0,0,0,0

This is the reason for that... I have a few Jewish friends, and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that. I never really make jokes about the holocaust, because that never go over well with them and it is not nice... well, apparently, a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew, but claims he is.... now he thinks I am a facist, nazi, and I hate jews.... i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage... Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to """"self identify as a nazi""""? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, """"This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won't let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please? My last comment is in response to Chzz's question about me making the 'gay comment' statement.

UCMMA is, along with BAMMA and Cage Warriors, the biggest MMA promotion in the United Kingdom. Secondly, after glancing over WP:MMANOT and WP:ATHLETE, I see that they are indeed guidelines. Now I may be cut from a different cloth from you two in terms of how we see what a guideline is but to me, a guideline is optional when it comes to following it, meaning that they cannot be used in AfDs as the sole reason why to delete any article. Thirdly, I have spent much time working on the page (as well as being the creator of the page), I have found very strong sources from websites such as The Sun, The Mirror as well as finding information that goes beyond it from being a 'typical' mixed martial artist's Wikipedia page, as it has information about him being on a reality tv show called Party Wars, and being the headline of an article in which he got into issues with the police for his tactics whilst working as a Wheel Clamper only strengthens his notability. The very sources on him alone helps him pass WP:GNG, which is all you need to pass a page on Wikipedia in my opinion.I would welcome constructive ideas about improving the page even more, but to talk about deleting the page without informing me first of this discussion I find is a bit disrespectful towards me, however I fairness to you we haven't exactly known each other for a while, so now I have adding myself to the topic and given the facts of the page's position on Wikipedia, now we can talk to help improve the page even more.    User:Pound4Pound Since you filed the SPI, I wanted to update you that I've reversed the block.  I requested another editor to review the case, and while there are a lot of coincidences, he felt it was borderline enough based on behavior, that the block should be reversed and instead just monitor the situation.  I had some reservations going into the block, but it seemed likely, however, I fully respect the review and would ask we all give the benefit of the doubt in this case.  I completely see why you reported it (I did block, after all), so there is no question as to your faith here.  Just wanted to update you.  - 2?  ?

Here's the first page of the search results (with links to the subsequent pages as well):  http://www.chaf.lib.latrobe.edu.au/dcd/pitikaresults.php?title=&start;=60&to;=70&searchstring;=mah€purisalakkha?.  Of course, this is by no means a straightforward indicator of how many discourses actually reference this term (nor what this term means in the context of various suttas) since multiple records can be part of a single sutta.  (Similarly, this is not a clear reflection of the total number of times that this term appears in the Pali literature as a single record could have multiple instances of the term and their might be other ways of formulating this phrase not addressed by the above truncated compound term, etc.).  FWIW, a quick review of these results (potentially suggestive of the distribution of this term in the various nikayas) shows 40 hits in the Digha Nikaya, 15 in the Majjhima Nikaya, none in the Samyutta Nikaya, 3 in the Anguttara Nikaya, and 7 in the """"canonical"""" Khuddaka Nikaya (mostly in the Suttanipata), 5 in the paracanonical KN words (e.g., Netti, Peta), one in the Abhidhamma's Kathavatthu, once in the Visuddhimagga, and 5 times in the Pali histories.

(talk - contrib)  (As it says on my talk page, I prefer to have discussions all in the same place. I am watching this page, so please reply here. To this end I have taken the liberty of moving your previous reply here.) So if I add a statement that there are no vacuum tubes in SSDs either, you'll insist on a source for that too?  Seriously, you are mistaken on a few points. I think you need to read WP:VERIFY yourself:   All material in Wikipedia mainspace, including everything in articles, lists and captions, must be verifiable. All quotations and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged, must include an inline citation that directly supports the material. Any material that needs a source but does not have one may be removed. (emphasis added - jeh)  Note the distinction. You wrote """"if it can't be verified it gets removed"""". But, first, the claim that SSDs contain no disks obviously can be verified. Not only is it part of the definition of the term, the very first reference in that very article confirms this claim in its description of these devices. So, no, we don't need to cite a source for this particular instance of the claim.  And second, except for BLP issues, WP:V only states that unsourced material that needs a source may be removed. This material didn't need a source, and even if it did, it isn't required to remove it right away. Even for claims that really should have a citation to a WP:RS, the polite and widely accepted thing to do is to add a """"citation needed"""" template. See template:cn. This is a much less abrasive thing to do to someone's edit rather than simply reverting it.  I suppose you could say """"well, since I removed it, its verifiability has been challenged so now it does require a source."""" Yeah, fine. So I go to the work of adding a reference name to one of the refs that's already there, and then cite that same ref from my new text as well. No, it's not much work, but consider: Does it really improve the article to add a reference footnote number to a statement that is as obviously true as this one? Is adding that little footnote number really the best use of my time here? Was it the best use of yours? And will this little challenge you raised over a completely trivial edit and obvious claim make me feel more or less eager to contribute to WP in the future?  Also: In my edit I merely noted that despite the term """"solid state disk"""" there are no actual """"disks"""" inside these devices. In your edit comment you said """"since they refer to it is a disk we must to [sic]"""". Well, that is true, but my edit did not remove any reference to the terms """"solid state disk"""" or """"electronic disk"""" from the article, nor even claim that such were wrong. So your edit comment was off point and provided no valid justification for your action.  Finally, I must point out that you are wrong about vandalism. The fact is that edits made in good faith are not generally considered vandalism. After reading WP:VERIFY you should probably look at WP:VANDALISM:Even if misguided, willfully against consensus, or disruptive, any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia is not vandalism. Edit warring over content is not vandalism. Careful consideration may be required to differentiate between edits that are beneficial, detrimental but well-intentioned, and vandalizing. Mislabelling good-faith edits as vandalism can be considered harmful. (emphasis added - jeh) You should probably also read WP:AGF to see what """"good faith"""" means and what you are supposed to do about assuming it.   In sum: Please be careful about undo'ing others' edits until you are more familiar with the actual prescriptions of things like WP:VERIFY. Consider using the CN template rather than reverting unsourced material. Please think carefully before tossing around words like """"vandalism"""".  And you should never have """"intentions of edit-warring"""", so the statement that you don't have any here is troubling.

Understandable and taken in good humor, of course, and nothing on the page is sourced (it's more of a stub than anything).  But I'm curious why you were so sure it was fabricated.  )  xkcdI find it hard to believe that a 22-year-old could have been working full-time for NASA. Of course, you may well be freakishly gifted and the kind of person that NASA would have been all over, but it just seems ever so slightly hard to believe.  - Schreit mich an I interned there during college and started working for them a bit before I graduated.  I stayed for the better part of a year until late 2006.  NASA is a huge organization with a tremendous number of contract positions on all sorts of projects.

I guess it's probably safest to assume that I am.In that case, I'll admit my mistake and congratulate you on interning and working in a pretty impressive place (I know very little about science, but anyone who got to work for NASA has got to be a smart cookie in that kind of area).

09e6671247cde0ff,"""History of Primal Therapy articleI read through the recent discussions on Talk:Primal_therapy. I also added two more comments to the Talk:Arthur_Janov page. Did you send an email enquiry? The 1973 date for France D's marriage to Art is without credibility. After the divorce, to Vivian's great credit, she avoided the temptation to publicly humiliate Arthur Janov. After all, he wrote in the original Primal Scream: """"It is instructive to note that married couples who have both gone through Primal Therapy have never separated."""" (chapter 12). And according to France D. Janov's own admission in the Primal Center's Video Series 2, she enrolled at the Primal Institute because excessive marihuana use had broken down her gates. So it's a fact that Art married a former patient.My feeling is that despite being tagged as a stub, the content of the Arthur Janov article is just about right for an encyclopedia entry. It isn't really the place to dissect Janov's reputation. I know it happens in other Wikipedia biographies, but in many cases it has got out of hand. I agree with your suggestion on the Primal therapy Talk page that this kind of material belongs in a separate History of Primal Therapy article. The Conocer piece doesn't strike me as a sound source of verifiable information, so I put together some links to articles which can be found online:If you type Emotional Intelligence into Google the No.1 result is Steve Hein's eqi.org website. He interviewed a former patient who attended Arthur Janov's Primal Center in the late 1990's. You can find his interview notes here, labelled """"cautionary note"""".Janov's bio on the Primal Center website states: """"The latest research conducted at Dr. Janov黶 Primal Center on the effects of Primal Therapy on the brain was performed by Dr. Erik Hoffman, former Professor of Neurophysiology at Copenhagen University."""" You can read  what Erik Hoffmann, Ph.D., is doing now at Hoffmann's website.On this page you can find a transcript of Dr. E. Michael Holden's account of what happened to him after he left the Primal Institute.Carol Mither's book, Therapy Gone Mad, identifies case histories from Janov's first two books that were written by defendants in the lawsuits against The Center for Feeling Therapy.  Simon ( )Thanks, Simon - Why can't you create an account like normal Wikipedians complete with a talk page? I don't think the History idea will come to much, There is just insufficient well sourced information to make much out of it - especially in view of Cgingold's latest analyses on the Primal Therapy talk page regarding derogatory statements about living individuals. I have already read the Michael Holden swan song twice - sad case.  You seem to be applying two standards of evidence. The Primal Therapy article gives an outline of primal theory based on Arthur Janov's books alone, which were written to attract paying customers to his exclusive and expensive private treatment center. Last September, I wrote in the Primal Therapy talk page: Will the article have something to offer readers who want to know about Stettbacher's method, or the International Primal Association, or the plethora of copycat primal centers that flourished in the 1970s? There is sufficient well sourced information available for a history article  for a start, two books about The Center for Feeling Therapy, Erik Hoffmann's bio, and the transcript of Dr. E. Michael Holden's audio tape which was played a number of times at the IPA convention in 1983. The books by Carol Mithers and Tomas Videg?rd are already referenced in the main article. I have a copy of Videg?rd's book, by the way. Also, Professor Steven Rose wrote a one-page account of his research with Arthur Janov in Lifelines:""""As Janov had hoped, it turned out that before therapy, the quantity of these particular receptors in his client's platelets was considerably below normal. Within six months of therapy, clients' depression had lifted, and the biochemical and immunological measures I was making approached the average for 'normal' non-depressed people of the same age and sex.""""Further down the same page he added:""""I obtained similar biochemical results when, a couple of years later, I did a similar study with depressed clients going through other, less dramatic forms of psychotherapy, so I suspect that in such cases the therapist matters more than the therapeutic theory.""""Having participated in the editing of articles in t",0,0,0,0,0,0

09fe77bf4504be96,""" Trimming sounds fine, but where a dispute comes up, I would recommend slowing things down.  Focus on one or two specific quotes, and if someone reverts, instead of immediately reverting back, try to come up with a compromise version.  Ditto with the other person reverting, instead of immediately pushing the article back to your own preferred version, try to come up with a compromise.  With each person changing each other's work, rather than reverting, it will probably be much easier to try and come up with a consensus version. Also, use clear, calm, and neutral edit summaries, referring strictly to the article, and not the editors. In terms of refactoring, what I was referring to was cases where a particular editor was being referred to.  When a post is phrased such as """"You did this wrong"""" or """"He is unwilling"""" or """"He's just always stubborn"""", then that's getting away from discussing the article content, and is veering off into discussing the editors.  Better is to try and phrase talkpage posts without referring to editors.  Good habits to develop (though they can take  time to get the hang of it), are to avoid the words """"you"""" and """"your"""". Also, avoid naming specific editors in a post, as that often has the immediate result of making someone defensive, and then they may miss everything else that's said. Instead, when it is necessary to refer to a specific thing that was done, diff the edit without mentioning the editor.  Like, """"I disagree with this edit (diff), as I feel it's a violation of (policy/guideline).  A better way to handle things would be (suggestion)""""  I know it may sound a bit confusing to do this, but I have seen that using this kind of third-party discussion technique, can work wonders in de-escalating disputes.  It also tends to make whoever is using the technique, sound extraordinarily calm and thoughtful, even if off-wiki they may be hopping mad. ) It also has the added benefit of making things much easier for administrators to take action.  When an uninvolved admin comes to a page in dispute, and they see everyone yelling at each other, the admin normally assumes that everyone is a bit in the wrong.  The admin won't care """"who started it"""", they'll just address things as they see them in that moment.  But if an admin comes to a page and sees five editors discussing things calmly, and one editor being uncivil, then it makes it much easier to figure out how to reduce the disruption.  Caveat: Just because one editor is being uncivil, doesn't necessarily mean that they're in the wrong.  But if the discussion has degraded to the point where all they're doing is name-calling, rather than actually discussing the article, then that's a problem that an administrator can easily address, by removing the non-constructive editors from the discussion. onka """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I did that because that article seemed to be slanted towards a pro-Lefebvre position as well.  I felt that it did not have enough information to give people the chance to make an accurate assessment about Lefebvre.  The two people who I called arch conservative were exactly that.  Both men tried to derail the Second Vatican Council, and fought both John XXIII and Paul VI and all those who were in favor of reform every step of the way.  I don't know if Thomas Jefferson actually said this or not, it was a quote the Jefferson character made in the movie 1776 that he felt that King George III was a tyrant even if they did not include call him a tyrant in the Declaration of Independance, so he thought they might as well call him a tyrant.  And I have talked to Catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals - especially in the times before the Second Vatican Council.  Why do you think that sexual abuse of children became such a crisis for the church?  It was because of a long standing church policy to protect the clergy at the expense of the laity.  I remember talking to an older gentleman whose grandfather left the church for a while, he didn't exactly what his grandfater's reasons were, but he said it probably wasn't hard to guess why.Even if people were supressing the faults of the new mass, it appears to me that the pendelum swung the other way, that the article was stuffed full of criticism on the new mass, but anything on the benefits was totally removed from this article.

In several instances you were very quick to delete material that didn't yet have a source. Yet I was able to quite readily find a source for the deleted material.

d3b79eed65949879,"""GA review processWell, the review process was instructive, as were the comments regarding how to improve the article. I had no idea that it was wrong to approach individual editors to comment (as I explained above it was to """"get the ball rolling"""" ?naivety on my part, I'm afraid). I also think that Pyrotec's choice of language here (""""This review looks very much like a """"favour"""" being granted to the article's nominator by a co-conspirator"""") is very regrettable ?perhaps he would like to retract it, look again at the six editors I asked to review the article (I chose a cross-section of editors experienced in CC pages but who had not made a contribution here ?also explained above), and admit that he jumped to conclusions. Another example of why good faith is so important. Anyway in future, I'll just make a general post on the talk page about GA nominations. From the comments re: the article itself it's clear that the article needs work in certain areas. Specifically:MOS issues, esp. with regard to the synopsisRestructuring of criticism section and dealing with """"stubby paragraphs""""Consistency in spelling Overlong sentences in synopsis (although Guetterda's criticism """"the synopsis is written in a narrative form - x happened, then the author introduced y, then z happened - which is inappropriate for the synopsis of a book of this form"""" may be misplaced as the book is a chronological account of this subject) Delingpole's review quoted in the lead but not the main body Further critical review needed/possible problems with tone Needs more imagesThat should be enough to be getting along with)) I don't regard the rejection as a setback, but merely a blip on the road to getting The Real Global Warming Disaster to GA status one day, in strict compliance with WP guidelines, though I still have reservations about how wise it was to choose a book from this subject area.

d3f5fd7ac71bb657,"Wellington Metropolitan vs Wellington Urban As someone who has lived in Wellington off and on for 20 years (I now regard it as my home town):In all of this one crucial fact is overlooked, the Wellington Metropolitan area includes the Kapiti Coast as far as Waikanae. There are several thousand people who commute to other parts of the urban area everyday and the Suburban rail network goes to Paraparaumu, with a planned extension to Waikanae. Almost everyone I know thinks of the Kapiti area as part of Greater Wellington.So I am left wondering why the boffins in Wellington refuse to include this area in the Urban data. Yes I know there is the stretch of road past Paekakariki, but that's no different from the Haywards Road or the Hutt Road. In reality, in spite of the classifications, Wellington remains the second largest Metropolitan Area in New Zealand, by my calculation the population including the Kapiti suburbs is around 415,000, still around 30,000 more than Christchurch. If Christchurch gets to include non-contiguous suburbs (eg Halswell, Lyttelton), then so should Wellington. Not only that, Banks Peninsula was included in Christchurch in 2006 so that Bob Parker could become mayor of Christchurch and promote Christchurch as the second largest city in NZ. The reality is Christchurch has an inferiority complex, and I can say that because I'm from there. It doesn't change the fact that Wellington has more people and is more important than Christchurch, no matter which way the geographers and politicians want to spin it.Instead of merging the pages how about creating a new one for GREATER WELLINGTON, which could include Kapiti.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Natural selection works on the phenotype, the outward form determined by genes (the genotype), the environment and the interaction between them. Only heritable variations in a trait will be passed on to the next generation and the frequency of favourable heritable traits will increase in subsequent generations. The underlying genetic variation in traits is the result of genetic processes, such as mutations and recombinations, and can undo the effect of natural selection if strong enough relative to the effect of natural selection. Natural selection, together with other mechanisms such as genetic drift and mutations, is an important component of evolution, a cornerstone of modern biological and medical research.The term was introduced by Charles Darwin in 1859 in his book """"The Origin of Species"""", as an analogy with a farmer choosing individuals that possess desired characteristics for his breeding stock, which Darwin called artificial selection.Maybe you find it not god, and in that case, I am curious what you think of that.  I made a lits of aspects here: User_talk:KimvdLinde/Natural_selection#Natural_selection_aspects  DeMarco-Becket Memorial TrophyYou did a lot of reversions to [[",0,0,0,0,0,0

Just never got around to it (and I had some disagreement from other editors at that time). What do you think, Will? Would this be a good idea? ?(talk) Another pseudo-source I see used often are some books called something like the """"Webster Book of quotations on Politics"""" (but that's not it), which are issued on a variety of topics. They cite their source as Wikipedia, but they abbreviate it """"WP"""" and many editors don't catch that.  I think there's merit in a central list. It wouldn't fluctuate much - books aren't going to be re-issued to address the problem, though some websites might fix it. The only gray area I see are those sources which cite Wikipedia, where it's possible to exclude the WP-sourced content and still use the other parts. I suppose that a search of the RSN archives and of pages that link to WP:CIRCULAR would find most instances that have been discussed. This problem is only going to get worse as Wikipedia continues to grow and as publishers grow more desperate for profit in a dwindling market. ??talk? I agree. The problem will only get worse and, over time, it becomes more difficult to parse the article histories to determine if/when the article was copied. And rather than search through the growing mountain of archives, it would be nice to be able to quickly direct an editor to a previous discussion  especially in cases like ISHA and Gyan which will obviously pop up again. I think what would work is a page with a table format which lists the title, the publisher, a link to the RSN archived discussion, and a Notes column which discuss those 'gray areas""""  whether the entire source is copied or particular chapters/sections.

However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche.

But as Jack and Meg (or Puffy and J.Lo or Britney and Justin) will tell you, sometimes couples that look like they're perfect for each other just aren't meant to be. Sigh...Black Key Dan Auerbach told Billboard.com recently that his band and Fat Possum have parted ways, and they are currently shopping around for an American home for their forthcoming album, which they hope torelease on September 12. (V2 will put the record out in Europe, and Modular will handle it in Australia.) Although the album is untitled at the moment, songs slated to appear include """"Your Touch"""", """"TheFlame"""", and """"It's Just Got to Be"""". Auerbach assured Billboard.com that the Fat Possum split was """"amicable."""" Yeah, yeah, they all say that, but this time we actually believe it, for quite a few reasons. First of all, Auerbach and hisbandmate, Patrick Carney, will leave the Mississipi imprint with a parting gift in the form of the Chulahoma: The Songs of Junior Kimbrough EP. A six-song tribute to the late bluesman (with ananswering machine message from Kimbrough's wife tacked on at the end), the disc hits stores May 2. It includes """"The Black Keys - My Mind Is Ramblin'"""", whichthe Keys covered on last year's Fat Possum Kimbrough tribute album, Sunday Nights.Tracklist:01 Keep Your Hands Off Her02 Have Mercy on Me03 Work Me04 Meet Me in the City05 Nobody But You06 My Mind Is Ramblin'Also, Fat Possum will continue to distribute Carney's Audio Eagle label, which has so far put out the Gil Mantera's Party Dream albumBloodsongs. Future releases include stuff by two Carney side projects, 10% Animals and Marble Arches. The latter also features guitarist Jamie Stillman (ex-party of helicopters), who co-runs Audio Eagle.That's kind of the rock and roll equivalent of seeing the kid every other weekend, right?The Black Keys are currently in the midst of an Australian tour, which has them playing some weird festivals with people like Femi Kuti andBuddy Guy. In May, they'll head to England to rock The Shins-curated date of All Tomorrow's Parties.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

(Kill-Marry-Fuck):The concept and game of K.M.F. was first commissioned by Courtney Porcella?esident of the City of Sin, Lynn, MA?n the early twenty first century in the United States of America, more specifically Massachusetts.  Spreading initially as ?ill-Marry-Fuck?between her and her close friends, this game quickly spread throughout the fourth floor of Donahue at Suffolk University, the school she currently attends.  Although this game quickly manifested itself into a game of pastime, it has never reached its full potential as an ice breaker due to the lingering question of its social acceptability.Prior to the spring of 2010, K.M.F. was referred to as its founding name, ?ill-Marry-Fuck.? The cause of the name change was brought on by a Senator from Suffolk University? Student Government Association.  The main reason behind the move for the change was to reflect the professionalism of the student leaders occupying the offices on the fourth floor of Donahue.  Although K.M.F. was never targeted specifically, people got the message from the Senator and changed its name respectively.Rega.Regardless of the name change, K.M.F. never lost it original essence, Donahue黶 pastime.  And the name change now allows players to play K.M.F. in all types of atmosphere, ranging from weddings to preschool school.  Less than a year after the publicizing of K.M.F., this game has expanded to Boston黶 neighboring cities.At the time, Ms. Porcella has no disclosed plans to spread K.M.F. statewide or nationally. # #",0,0,0,0,0,0

Now, passing to your last message, let me thank you for having clearly stated your objections. Now I'll try to awnser your points: Tito's actions had a number of important consequences for the Macedonians. The most important was, obviously, the promotion of a distinctive Macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of Yugoslavia. The process of ethnogenesis gained momentum, and a distinct national Macedonian identity was formed.The first part was already there: """"Tito's actions had a number of important consequences for the Macedonians. The most important was, obviously, the promotion of a distinctive Macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of Yugoslavia."""" As for the second part, """"The process of ethnogenesis gained momentum, and a distinct national Macedonian identity was formed"""", I admit responsability; but I only wanted to mean that the birth of the SRoM represented the completition of the formation of a Macedonian national identity, not that Macedonians were """"invented"""" in 1945; an identity that freed itself of the ambiguities and contraddictions that were present in the fathers of Macedonian nationalism, like Misirkov and Delchev. If you want to put it better, feel free to do it.Greek Macedonians are actually an ethnic groupI think you know quite well how I feel about this, as I clearly stated it in the talk page. But sometimes compromises are necessary; and after all, it's only stated that """"Greek Macedonians"""" live in Macedonia, not that they represent an ethnic group. And it does seem that the Greeks who live in Macedonia call themselves Macedonians,like those that live in Crete call themselves Cretans.Tito separated Yugoslav Macedonia from SerbiaI think you must have wrongly interpreted this; I simply thought it meant that Macedonia was administratively separated from Serbia, under whose control in the Kingdom of Serbia before and that of Yugoslavia after it had beenThere was no resentment towards the Bulgarian repression during the beginning of the Bulgarian occupation of the region, by removing that sentance.Honestly the removal of this sentence slipped me, but I can't help noting now that the statement is unsourced. Personally, I don't know how Macs reacted to Bulgarian occupation. After all, my field is ancient, not modern Macedonia.In conclusion remember that I only edited Telex's text, without adding new statements.In my view, the best way to awnser to those editors who say that the Macedonians were invented in 1945 is in collecting good, strong sources. For example, to make some names, Danforth's Macedonian Question or Poulton's Who are the Macedonians.As for Telex, you should remember that it's a wiki rule to not bite newbies. Telex is a very recent that is among us only since April 25, and is clearly not a nationalist, but a honest editor who is striving to be NPOV. If you believe to see bias in his editing, remember that every single editor here (me included, obviously) has his POV, and it's a pure illusion that we can kept them out of our editing. This is why wikipedia has great possibilities: because our bias are emended by the work of others. Sorry this was so long. Ciao ;-) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

d7d48a99a0cf0bf3,"""  Hi.  Yes, that old conversation seemed to disappear.   Medeis removed it, citing a policy about """"threats of harm"""", as you indicated.  I reviewed it, after this deletion.  The OP said something like """"Geez, if I had to do life in prison, I'd rather die ... or I'd rather kill myself"""" (or some such).  Medeis took that as a suicide threat.  And did the """"threat of harm"""" removal.  The policy cited states something like """"take all threats seriously, don't assume that the threat is a joke"""".  I did not think it applied to that particular thread.  But, in picking and choosing my battles, this is not one of them.  Anyone  including me  might say """"I'd rather die than serve life in prison"""".  In fact, most people would say that!  And I don't think that constitutes a threat of suicide.  Particularly  by the way  given the fact that I (or the OP) did not in fact receive a life sentence.  A silly deletion.Back to double jeopardy.  We seem to disagree.  And I do not have the wherewithal to engage in legal research at the moment.Yes, it is my understanding that when a new trial is ordered, everyone starts from scratch, from square one.  (I am sure we both recognize that many things can happen in an appeal.  They are rarely cut-and-dry; they are rarely black-and-white.  But, in the cut-and-dry case of """"new trial is ordered"""", it is my belief that the prosecution starts with a clean slate and that nothing is """"off limits"""".  I say this as a general rule.  Perhaps the death sentence has some """"extra special"""": rules associated with it.  But, even that, I am suspect of.In your case where the defendant is actually acquitted (on one charge), of course no retrial can occur (on that charge).  But, again, it depends on the appeal.  I am quite certain that the defense did not appeal the acquittal.  I am sure he appealed the """"rest of the trial"""" which did not favor his client.  So, in other words, the charge acquitted (assault and battery, in your example) is not even under consideration in the appeal.  An appeal usually has several points being appealed (not just one).  And the justices review each point, one by one.  So, in your hypothetical case, the defense would not be """"complaining about"""" (i.e., appealing) an acquittal that went in their favor.  They would be appealing the other things that transpired in the trial.  So, the final order of the justices might read """"a new trial is ordered with respect to the robbery charge"""" (or some such).  Now, do you have a case to cite that supports your contention? Thanks.

I recognize weasel wording dilemmas, but seriously, this accurately portrays the qualitative information without misleading.  Not necessary. The """"debate"""" over global warming is long over. The """"debate"""" was a farce created by the people who wanted to pretend that it didn't exist. There is no reason to cater to them. It's an insult to honesty and good science.  If we're talking about this part:It is the largest single source of fuel for the generation of electricity world-wide, as well as one of the largest sources of carbon dioxide emissions, which is considered the primary cause of global warming. Coal is extracted from the ground by coal mining, either underground mining or open pit mining (surface mining).Then I don't see a problem with the global warming statement (except """"is considered"""" isn't specific), but saying it is """"one of the largest sources"""" is a weasel approach and sounds uninformed.

This sentence is not supported, and ignores the growth in coal consumption trends, and is therefore unencyclopedic. Please support it per WP:RS or it will be removed shortly.   Actually the only reason it is there is because someone else had the questionable statement that coal could provide the entire planet with all of its energy for 600 years, which was based on the typographical error that has been fixed.

Coal and oil are so close to each other that it is not easy to definitively say that either is the largest. Coal is also increasing much faster than oil, which is likely to be declining soon, if it hasn't already begun to decline.   Question about units The article sometimes measures coal consumption in tonnes (metric tons, one tonne = 1000 kg) and sometimes in tons, which could be either the short ton (2000 lb) or the long ton (2200 lb).

Again, the answer from the CDC and from your sources is that the assumption is that MTF TS/TG are reported as MSM, and FTM are just pretty much ignored...

Again, being that my medical records indicate me as female, and I continue to be asked """"are you pregnant?"""" when getting x-rays indicates that I would not be reported as a male to the CDC.

da174b5696a768a5,"""Slpl1, Please!! The situation is NOT """"an exact parallel"""" to the examples you've given, especially the first. In that example you're comparing a matter of hard science to a highly subjective jouranistic description. Basketballs to oranges. We don't have a choice as to what causes AIDS. We can't say, for example, that it is caused by a severe deficiency of Vitamin C because that would simply be false. But in the case of the men's rights movement there are all sorts of descriptions, ones used by """"scholars"""" no less, that would not be false. We could say that the MRM is a countermovement to feminism, a reaction to feminism, a response to feminism, a rebellion against feminism, etc. And, by the way, were we addressing the subject of AIDS, we also wouldn't say """"It is considered to be a caused by the HIV virus"""" would we? Rather, we would say that """"AIDS is caused by the HIV virus"""" or, to more explicitly bring in outside authority, """"AIDS has been determined to be caused by the HIV virus."""" That's because """"is considered to be"""" also brings in a degree of subjectivity to the statement.Your second example is closer to our situation and, to be honest, it isn't all that obviously unacceptable to me. However, in the case of Holocaust denial we are almost invariably dealing with clear-cut antisemitism and scholars and editors should call a spade a spade. In the case of the MRM, I think that both scholarly and popular literature will reflect that we are not dealing with the same degree of monolithic hatred. Moreover, unlike Holocaust denial, standard issue MRM causes don't reflect a flat-out denial of historical fact.What I see in the present """"It is considered to be a backlash to the feminist movement"""" wording, are editors taking the most negative description of the movement that they could """"get away with""""  (saving the even less acceptable """"misogynist"""" for a segment of the movement later in the lead) and then framing it in the least subjective manner that they could """"get away with"""": """"It is considered to be"""". I don't particularly like """"backlash"""" in lead, but at least in should be framed in the more NPOV """"many scholars and other observers have described it as a backlash . . .

da235b25ca02b6b8,""" To attempt to briefly several of Ed's questions from what I can only hope is an Eastern Orthodox Christian POV: * Nothing """"compels"""" a just God to """"enforce"""" a person's separation from Him, save the principle of the person's free will. If a person chooses not to love God, or chooses a life separate from God, that amounts to the same as choosing death, since they are cutting themselves off from the ultimate source of life. Looking at the word """"perish"""" in John 3:16, in Greek it is in neither active nor passive voice, but rather """"middle voice"""", which means a better translation would be """"whoever does not believe in him will destroy himself"""". Living in the presence of an all-loving God while rejecting that love is how some Orthodox theologians describe Hell; hence, God's love is sometimes described as a """"river of fire"""". Hence both God's goodness and justice are preserved, as well as each person's free will. * Also, Jesus did not have to die. To say that he was forced to die would imply that some external force or law is greater than God and forced God to act against His will. Eastern Orthodoxy has always rejected this notion, and rather says that Jesus chose to lay down his life in order trample down death by death. When Death tried to swallow up the the Giver of Life, Death's power was overcome. As for alternative plans, none are discussed, but that's not the same as saying that God had no choice or was compelled by something or someone else. Some Church Fathers speak of Christ triumphantly mounting the Cross like a steed. * The Jews did not have to accept Jesus as their Messiah. He simply was their Messiah; it was not an elected office, and their choices did not change this fact, did not prevent his triumphant death or his resurrection. Many Jews did believe in him, many more did not. Hope this helps. I'll have to look another time at whether or how any of this should affect the article, as I'm obviously coming in very late to an old discussion.  17:15 Sep 9, 2002 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I chose a couple of genres of music that are popular in different countries to explain how something may be popular in one context, but not another. The edit also discusses how the digitization of music has impacted the popular music field by allowing artists to become famous through social media. I am still not totally confident with my edit because it is very short at this point and I am nervous that I am trying to discuss different genres too in depth. I am also nervous that I am trying to make an argument out of this article because I am discussing the different countries' popular music genres. Later this week or this weekend I will be linking my proposed edit to this talk page. Thank you!   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Physically, the R and the G arise due to completely different reasons:  R is due to the small, yet finite, resistivity in the non-ideal metal conductor(s) of the line, whereas G is due to the small, yet again finite, conductivity of the non-ideal dielectric material between the metal conductor(s) of the line.  Therefore, in a lossless transmission line, where the metal is a perfect conductor and the dielectric is a perfect insulator, the metal exhibits no resistivity and the dielectric exhibits no conductivity.  Hence, the characteristic impedance of the lossless line reduces to Z0 = sqrt(L/C).To look at it another way, the non-ideal metals and dielectrics that are used in transmission lines (which is practically the case) are the root cause of signal distortion, but by implementing Heaviside's condition distortionless transmission lines can be designed even with lossy materials.NOTE:  I keep using the terms """"lossy"""" and """"lossless.""""  """"Lossy"""" simply means the transmission line has some R and/or G associated with it, and since any resistance when none is wanted (or conversely any conductance when non is wanted) results in loss of some of the energy of a signal, a signal propagating through a """"lossy"""" transmission line will lose some energy.

I believe that Spanish speaking populations outside Ceuta and Melila are neglectable. I'm raising this issue at the Commons. Tnak you!  The text even states that Northern Morocco was a Spanish colony! if you read the article on Morocco, the situation was much more complex, it states """"Successful Portuguese efforts to invade and control the Atlantic coast in the fifteenth century did not profoundly affect the Mediterranean heart of Morocco. After the Napoleonic Wars, Egypt and the North African maghreb became increasingly ungovernable from Istanbul, the resort of pirates under local beys, and as Europe industrialized, an increasingly prized potential for colonization. The Maghreb had far greater proven wealth than the unknown rest of Africa and a location of strategic importance affecting the exit from the Mediterranean. For the first time, Morocco became a state of some interest in itself to the European Powers. France showed a strong interest in Morocco as early as 1830. Recognition by the United Kingdom in 1904 of France's sphere of influence in Morocco provoked a German reaction; the crisis of June 1905 was resolved at the Algeciras Conference, Spain in 1906, which formalized France's """"special position"""" and entrusted policing of Morocco to France and Spain jointly. A second Moroccan crisis provoked by Berlin, increased tensions between European powers. The Treaty of Fez (signed on March 30, 1912) made Morocco a protectorate of France. By the same treaty, Spain assumed the role of protecting power over the northern and southern Saharan zones on November 27 that year.""""! """,0,0,0,0,0,0

db8359ca3d87ae8c,"""Eddie, the main problem with Wikipedia is that it benefits from the free time of many hundreds of thousands of individuals. So much spare time that it can treat them individually with contempt if it chooses, and get away with it, and not care very much, however much ill feeling that generates.If it had to pay people for the time they input, it would use that time responsibly. But it doesn't have to pay for it. So it doesn't have to manage the resource responsibly.Wikipedia cares very little how much effort any particular individual happens to put into any particular article. As far as Wikipedia is concerned, all of that effort can just be swept into the waste bin by someone else, the next person who happens to come along, if it suits that other person, and if that happens, it costs Wikipedia nothing, so why should Wikipedia give a damn really? It won't. Wikipedia can smile, shrug its collective shoulders, and say, """"The time you happened to waste isn't a cost to us so we really couldn't care less."""" The system lacks responsibility and wastes the time of countless individuals behind the scenes, and Wikipedia doesn't care about that. Why should it care, if it has millions of individuals as a free resource?Once one understands the system, and one returns to articles and finds that one's contributions have been generally mucked about with to the point where there was very little point in contributing in the first place, and that the essence of Wikipedia is to waste people's spare time, and that people aren't being organised sensibly, the only intelligent thing to do is walk away and not bother contributing. What is the point in carefully drafting things, concentrating on getting everything right, if anybody else is just at liberty to come along and chuck the whole thing out if it suits them? It's a daft system. The system works because you have so many people contributing, but the amount of individual time that gets wasted, and the amount of irritation that gets generated in the process, is, I imagine, collosal.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Moreover, German-speaking countries such as Austria have a tradition of excellence at anything related to solving complex engineering tasks. And lastly, Austria is in Europe and the way products are advertised in Europe is much more honest than the way they are advertised in the USA (features of products mentioned by European companies are nearly always true contrary to what happens in the USA!). Consequently, there is no reason to doubt that the features that B?sendorfer mentions on their web site concerning this new CEUS Computer Grand Piano will prove to be true when they will be assessed by independent parties.""""So, here is the new, latest version of my article; it should pleased even the worst complainers and prove that I am with no agenda at all!!The New (2006) B?endorfer Reproducing Grand Piano: the CEUS Computer Grand PianoDuring the past recent decades, a reproducing piano (also sometimes called a computer piano or a player piano) has been defined as being first an acoustic piano that is not diminished in any way in its ability to play piano pieces. The touch at the keyboard and the sound produced by a reproducing piano is not changed in any way compared to a normal acoustic piano. However, a reproducing piano has an unobtrusive computer interface that allows the pianist to record and playback the piano pieces that are performed on it. Usually, it also has a silent mechanism that stops the hammers from striking the strings and that allows the pianist to play silently at the keyboard, at any time during the day or the night without disturbing others, and with the option of using headphones to hear digital sounds while playing silently at the keyboard (many digital sounds are available: piano, harpsichord, organ, strings, etc.). It also has a MIDI interface that aallows the pianist to play back many pieces that are available on this particular MIDI format. The capability of a reproducing piano to convey the full expressiveness of the pianist at the keyboard is directly related to its ability to record and playback accurately the velocity of the hammers that are moved when the pianist presses the keys at the keyboard. However, the MIDI format allows the recording and playback of the velocity of the hammers of the piano only at a level of accuracy of 127 scales (or 127 steps if you prefer). The problem is that most of the pianistic techniques move the hammers at an incredibly high speed, making these 127 scales highly insufficient to be able to record and playback accurately the very high velocity of the hammers. Consequently, a reproducing piano usually also has a more accurate proprietary format to record and playback piano pieces at a much higher level of accuracy than the MIDI format. In summary, a reproducing piano is a very flexible musical instrument that combines the old (an acoustic piano) with the new (a MIDI format but especially the recording and playing back of the piano) at the same time. It allows the pianist to play the numerous MIDI piano pieces available but, more importantly, to record and playback piano pieces at a higher level of accuracy than it is possible to do with the MIDI format.The quality of the B?endorfer pianos and especially the sound that they produce are the result of a long and old tradition of piano making.B?endorfer also kept in touch with modernity. They took an active participation at making reproducing pianos first with their SE 290 computer piano that was made in collaboration with Wayne Stahnke. It was considered by the entire community of piano makers to be the most accurate reproducing piano of its time.At the beginning of 2006, B?endorfer introduced its next generation of reproducing pianos: the CEUS Computer Grand Piano.Previously to the B?endorfer CEUS Computer Grand Piano, several scientific studies were made that had for main goal to assess if the reproducing pianos that were available were as faithful to the expressiveness of the best performers at the piano as they should be. These studies concluded that the best reproducing pianos (including the SE 290 computer piano) were not as faithful at recording and playing back the performance of the best pianists as they should uld have been (see in particular """"Measurement and reproduction accuracy of computer-controlled grand pianos"""" by Werner Goebl, et al., August 6-9, 2003).Taking this conclusion as an incentive to raise the accuracy of its reproducing piano (the SE 290 computer piano), B?sendorfer set themselves to create an even more accurate reproducing piano that would accomplish THE VERY CHALLENGING GOAL OF BEING ABLE TO RECORD AND P",0,0,0,0,0,0

But I digress. While an autodidact (notice the second 'd') is defined as a self-taught person, it is not necessarily the case the reverse is true. But we are also talking about connotation and a quirk about English grammar. When you say a person """"is self-taught"""", because taught is in the past tense, it gives the impression of being in the past. It is also ambiguous, as people are likely to say/think/ask, """"self-taught in what?""""  But if you say a person is an autodidact, it maintains the present tense and does not suggest when the self-teaching occurred.  It also implies a general sense of being self-taught. For instance, I taught myself how to program computers. But I don't go around claiming I'm an autodidact. With Langdon, if you say he is """"self-taught"""" and mention his IQ and status as a bouncer, well, that hardly gives a meaningful impression. For that reason it's as I stated earlier  an approach to learning. Langan is generally self-taught (or something like that), but more critically, I think, his attitude seems to be """"why should I bother learning from someone who is my intellectual inferior"""".

dbdc8c2067bc4a64,""" be with you.]]The Force is something that makes others do things and stuff float at our command. It was discovered by George Lucas and revealed in his seven-and-two-thirds-part documentary Star Wars. Mark Hamill can use it, but Harrison Ford cannot. Not even while canoeing a fjord.The Force and ReligionIn the essential melodrama of Force-wielding, George Lucas uncovers the struggle of Light vs. Dark in his aforementioned documentary Star Wars. During the filming, Lucas resided with and studied a small group of Jedi, Catholic monks who police and protect the Galaxy in accordance with the Gospel description of Jesus' work. We learn early that the Jedi manipulate small bits of The Force by controlling ther emotion, waving their hands around in odd and nondescript ways, and moving junk around via telepathy.  Soon, we encounter the Sith, pimps of the Galaxy who use the Dark Side of the Force for to fulfill their passions for beer and hookers, gambling, and unlimited power. The Dark Side, of course, is a double-edge sword, or more accurately, a red lightpaper: it can cut the shit outta yo hands unless you hold it the right way.  It is for this reason that many Sith have met their untimely demise falling down shafts and electrocuting things as their dead ass falls.The Force and the Jedi OrderJedi training in the Presbyterian faith under Britney Spears (an anagram of Presbyterians) is a strenous and ancient ritual.  Boys and girls who show marked skills with the Force are granted training at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, where they learn Jedi skills, included amongst the many: lightsaber fighting, moving stuff with your mind, and convincing people these aren't the droids they're looking for.  While spending a number of years getting shot by remote droids, young Jedis in training learn about Jesus and his works, and the apostles, who were the first Jedi.  The Jedi Order has come under some severe scrutiny since a number of Padawan molestation cases during training in the Outer Rim territories.  Cardinal Yoda remains pensive.The earliest recording of The Force is when Moses crossed the Delaware.The second most Holy day of the Jedi Order is May 4th, colloquially recognized as 'May the 4th Be With You' day. The first most Holy day is Hannukah.The Force and the Sith LordthMany religious scholars blame the Sith, or the Jews, either way, for the murder and crucifiction of Jesus after Jesus balanced the Force.  However, many agree, except for those fascist scholarly types, that the Sith did not murder Jesus for religious reasons, but instead stood in the way to the creation of The First Galactic Empire as ruled by, then, Pope John Paul II.In the modern era, Many Sith were converted by door-to-door Force-marketers, a practice which is currently being aprised by the Supreme Court. If people choose not to convert to the Sith, the Sith use the Dark side to throw barrels, pipes, man hole covers, and freight trains through people's front windows or trap them in Force-fields until they can be used to make a rather fuckish shade of Soylent Green.The Force and RaceAn often-used explanation of The Force consists of Light and Dark sides of a spectrum, or, in computing terms, 256-bit values of RGB locked together. In this analogy, the Force draws upon the age-old battle of 'The White Man Repressin' against 'Nigger Stole my bike.'  """"Paradise Losticus,"""" of ancient, unknown authoring, is the most vivid and accurate account of the religious turmoil within the Force. In the climactic ending of the book, Sith Lord Darth Maul returns Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn's bike.The Light and Dark sides cannot coexist side-by-side, not even in Detroit.  Bickering on both sides has sparked off many Holy Wars, like the Crusades and as detailed in the six part documentary Star Wars.  The Light Side has come under significant fire in mordern times, despite its true purpose of """"Guarding of Peace and Justice."""" Many believe, probably due to Sith indoctrination, that this could just be bullshit for """"Defenders of Big Business and the Oil Industry.""""  This could explain why the Jedi Temple is on the wildly industrialized planet Coruscant, and the Sith live in ghettos like Cleveland.It is wholly undisputed that the Dark Side of the Force repre",0,0,0,0,0,0

I know that his title was King of the Romans but I think it is common WP pratice to use the term """"King of Germany"""" for that respective office to avoid confusion. Also, to say that there was no Germany at that time is wrong - there was a German Kingdom that was part (in fact the primary part of the Holy Roman Empire. And Albert was King of that Kingdom. I hope you understand.  (smile back) I rather disagree with you, but in a friendly way (I hate edit-war nonsense). I think it's possible to create links without necessarily making page titles黙nd there really are some atrocious ones about ('Ladislas the Posthumous' being one of them, in my opinion)黙ppear on the page in question. It is certainly possible and reasonable to call Albert """"King of the Germans"""" or """"German King"""" (the Germans themselves use the term """"R?misch-deutscher K?nig"""", which covers it nicely. But even here on English Wikipedia, where there are many mistakes in this matter, the term """"King of Germany"""" is rarely used. Of course there was a Germany at that time in the sense of a German-speaking volk,  but there was not a German kingdom in the sense of a political state ruled by a royal government (when a later King of the Romans, Ferdinand I, tried to administer Hungary and Bohemia from Vienna, he was rebuffed?and he wouldn't have even tried that much in principalities where he was not the dynastic prince, such as Saxony or Brandenburg); the nearest thing to a German kindom, the Carolingian kingdom of the East Franks (even that has been called the Kingdom of Germany only as a back-formation), had fragmented fairly quickly into a group of states with their own princes (in the case of Bohemia, an actual king). Albert II is an interesting case because in his purely German-speaking territories he was only a duke. His kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary, though part of the Holy Roman Empire, were largely non-German, which is another reason why Rex Romanorum is correct and not """"King of Germany"""".The English Wikipedia article on the subject is very inaccurate, announcing the academically unjustifiable decision to use the term """"Kingdom of Germany"""" for clarification's sake. In my opinion, having had this stuff drummed into me at university, where I had to read texts in Latin and German, that doesn't so much clarify as blur the issue. The title """"King of the Romans"""" may be difficult, and so may the idea of a group of independent German (and non-German) states within the Holy Roman Empire, but the readers of Wikipedia, in my opinion, shouldn't have history revised for them to make it fit the modern world (and Austria still isn't the same country as Germany anyway).

dd5392ba25f2c914,""" WTHR Today Today, WTHR consistently dominates every news timeslot.  WISH has been a close second except at 11PM where CBS has helped WISH move ahead. WTHR is also one of NBC's five strongest affiliates for primetime and news programming, ranking up with KUSA-TV in Denver and KSDK in St. Louis. This led to speculation that NBC Universal could buy the station from the Wolfe family and become NBC's first O&O; in Indiana and change to """"NBC 13"""".  However, NBC Universal recently decided that it only wants to own stations located in larger markets, selling four owned-and-operated stations in several mid-sized markets to Media General. The most likely purchaser for WTHR is thought to be the Gannett Company, which owns KUSA-TV.  It should be noted, however, that the Wolfe family tends to own businesses for the long-term.  Wolfe family businesses are profitable and carry very little debt, thus there is little incentive to sell.  The Wolfe family controlled BancOhio Corporation, once Ohio's largest bank holding company, for nearly 70 years.  The Wolfes also controlled The Ohio Company, once Ohio's largest brokerage, for nearly as long.  The Wolfes have owned The Columbus Dispatch since the late 1800s and have been in the broadcasting business since the 1920s.  The Wolfe family's last remaining interests are in the media and in real estate, thus it is highly unlikely that they are actively looking for buyers for WTHR.( )""",0,0,0,0,0,0

This came a week later and my relation was pleased. A few days before 14th November, we received another letter - this time a handwritten letter from Prince Charles - and a tin of biscuits from the Prince's organic estate. The Prince's handwriting is a bit difficult to read, but he made a joke in there which made my relation chuckle. He also said that because of the bad weather, a party for people of the same birthdate had been cancelled.DoberStaff  ?Preceding unsigned comment added by 212.183.128.4   """,0,0,0,0,0,0
dd9cb36c1c8ff36f,"""Ok, first off, let me clarify that reverting is when you undo someone else's edit (yes, it does include the re-addition of material that has been removed by another user). Your use of the word """"vandalism"""" is incorrect in this case, because everything that you have been involved in so far is classified as a """"content dispute"""", since you and your opponents have been disputing whether certain text should be included. This is not a case of vandalism (this is, for example). Secondly, many of the users that you have been reverting or the ones that have been reverting you are on the same restrictions, so IMO now everyone is equal, and no one is """"winning"""" or """"losing"""". What I've tried to explain to you is that edit wars get nothing accomplished. You keep reverting and reverting, and then someone reverts you, and the cycle continues. Wikipedia articles aren't meant to go back-and-forth like that. The only real way you get something accomplished is by discussing it with other users, in the hopes that you can form a compromise, or consensus. To answer your numbered questions:After we last spoke you continued to revert (, , , ). On Sason, you reverted 3 times in the last 24 hours. Even though you came close to breaking the three-revert rule (which you were blocked for on May 31), three reverts is not some sort of magic barrier that prevents you from being blocked. An admin could have easily blocked you for simply edit warring. This is the type of stuff that occurred on Armenian-Azeri pages for example before the arbitration case. After that many users were placed on editing restrictions, a lot of the problems were solved. Aggressive editing can be characterized as constant edit warring, and basically a method of getting your version of the article by constant reverting as opposed to discussion. Is is the exact opposite of what is outlined at WP:1RR. Even if you believe the information you are adding is NPOV, if it is contested by several users, the best thing is to discuss it with them, and once you have come to an agreement, to implement that version. I'm sure you've tried to be civil, but here I notice you referring to your opponents as """"vandals"""", this is inappropriate because as I explained above, you're involved in a content dispute here. If other users have personally attacked you, please show me links of this and I will warn them. It is never acceptable to do so.Yes, it is possible. You can get mentored at Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User. Wiki-adoption was created back in 2006 as a program designed to help new and inexperienced users.Although you may disagree with him, it is within Namsos' right to nominate an article for deletion if he believes it is non-notable. However, as you can see from the discussion at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erich Feigl, it appears that many users there are deciding to keep the article, so I'm not sure that it matters anyways. Everything that you mention (awards, documentaries, books, Google hits, etc.) can be mentioned at the AfD (articles for deletion page). I have noticed that you've already made a comment there already. Make sure to keep an eye on that page, the discussion is typically open for five days.I don't know the specifics about why your sources were removed, but if you feel like you're not getting anywhere with these disputes, you might try posting something at the Reliable Sources noticeboard if there is a dispute on whether your sources are valid or not. Another option is the new Ethnic and cultural conflicts noticeboard. Finally, after you have made all attempts at resolving the conflict (including those two links I gave you), and you still feel like nothing has been accomplished, you can check out formal mediation. There, a mediator will get involved and act as a third party.I hope all that I have said is helpful. Please feel free to drop a note on my talk page if you have any further questions/comments. khoi """,0,0,0,0,0,0

But, very few actually can cite facts, inaccurate edits, nor bother to even think about checking sources cited. It is much easier to """"complain about Theodore7"""" and to """"revert"""" since following Wikipedia's principles about biting newcomers is an """"excuse"""" since it """"does not exist"""" and """"does not happen"""" to any newcomer. And, if they mention it - they are """"using"""" it since it doesn't exist, etc., etc. This is just one of the many problems Wikipedia newcomers face with such people. It is so much easier not to care about any subject, nor to check sources (as I do as a journalist) and to find inaccurate and unfactual materials while avoiding POV. But, to play games, to have personality conflicts as if they actually know the people they are writing to. They avoid resolving matters peacefully, but highly enjoy creating fights, building molehills into mountains, and love throwing out wild accusations. They don't ask - they assume - they immediately accuse, then complain loudly. They take everthing personally - all the while - not reading, checking sources, nor citing sources themselves on the subjects in question but adding plenty of their own POV that is not neutral, nor cited with sources. If sources run counter to their POV - then they use ruses to attempt to divert attention: and ask for RFCs on Wikipedia members who just got here, and request arbitration to resolve situations they have not even started to resolve on their own - yet claiming that they have tried. Perhaps, if some spend much more time actually checking sources, citing them, and making sure that the encylopedic materials are factual then, the """"revert wars"""" by some who want to re-write history to fit their own personal views would end, and Wikipedia could be that much more successful. So, if one is to gather evidence - show just where my edits are vandalism - where? I'd like to see it. Show my edit summaries. Show my edits, and don't cite my early mistakes as """"proof"""" of being """"disruptive"""" since I'd like to see someone claim they do not make mistakes themselves. Oh, one more thing. When a person defends themselves - try not to dismiss it as a """"diatribe"""" - but actually read it in context and take responsbility for one's own """"claims"""" against the person - in this case, a new member of Wikipedia. I've had enough of my comments being taken out of context, then pasted onto RFC and arbitration sections - and used as """"proof"""" of me being a bad person, and disruptive. I say different, and have the right to defend myself against what I consider to be a classic case of biting Wikipedia newcomers. I will take credit for my honest mistakes, but not for accusations that are false. My evidence are the comments, and retorts, and my edits - which, are cited, and soucred. Any arbitrator who wants to know more about my edits and comments can feel free to ask, or to view my comments IN CONTEXT and not TAKEN OOUT OF CONTEXT by some who are doing the constant """"complaining."""" I see no proof of any infactual edits on my part. And, my early mistakes are just that - mistakes that most newcomers to Wikipedia make. That does not justify, say your own comments Bunchofgrapes, and those of the other """"revert warriors"""" - who, in my opinion, are ruining Wikipedia. So, I've made inquiries elsewhere to make sure that perhaps this comes to an end, and that my case can be used as an example of what happens - negatively - to newcomers who run up against those who signed the RFC, and asked for arbitration. My evidence is there - my work to this time, my edits, sourcing, and using the Talk Pages - which I do not abuse, but use to add comments relevant to the subject at hand""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Wiki has repeatedly deleted this entry.  I have found numerous examples of musicians, actors and such with a fraction of Mr. Wainer's success undeleted and untagged on Wikipedia.Mr. Wainer has not only co-written and produced 6 Billboard-charting musical compositions for artists from Foxy Brown to Sean """"Diddy"""" Combs (many of which I am positive you have heard), but has also played an integral role in the digital development of MTV's URGE online music delivery system and is the co-founder and guitarist in the band 13.  13 is the first band to be signed to music icon, LL Cool J's, new production label.  13 will be releasing a full length, major-label release in 2008 followed by an international tour. I am sure I do not have to tell you how significant any one of these achievements are individually, let alone all achieved by one 25 year old young man.Wikipedia is an excellent and innovative tool and resource for our industry and our fan base and I implore you, on behalf of Mr. Wainer and his countless fans, to restore the page which our PR manager, Mr. Lust, uploaded today.

I have fixed this. I also added the root ???-, which should only have the rough breathing as accent is not indicated for roots. Missing Ketone production ) In the article about Ketogenesis, it states """"Ketone bodies are produced mainly in the mitochondria of liver cells"""". This fact is missing from the functions of Liver.  黀receding unsigned comment added by 132.170.54.14    Liver regeneration and the Greeks On this page and the Prometheus page, someone has added a reference giving a bogus definition for the Greek word for liver, h?par, claiming that it  derives from the verb h?paomai, meaning to mend or repair. Thus h?par is supposed to translate as, """"repairable."""" This derivation is fanciful. I'm surprised it lasted as long on Wiki as it has since it wasn't even confirmed by the original source given! I've deleted this bogus definition. I doubt you need references for a deletion, but here are some anyway: J. Pokorny, Indogermanisches etymologisches W?rterbuch (Bern and Munich: Francke, 1959), pp. 325, 504; P. Chantraine, Dictionnaire ?tymologique de la lange grecque (Paris: Klincksieck, 1990), p. 414; H. Frisk, Griechisches etymologisches W?rterbuch, Vol. I (Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1973), pp. 638-9. These sources make it very doubtful that h?par was related to h?paomai.I've also changed some text in the section on Liver Regeneration which asserted that the myth of Prometheus proves that the ancient Greeks must have known about the liver's remarkable capacity to repair itself. Actually this is a matter of some dispute. I've changed the text to reflect this controversy. I黺e looked at a great deal of literature on the subject and have found only one attempt to actually argue that the Greeks knew about liver regeneration: Chen T and Chen P (1994). """"The Myth of Prometheus and the Liver."""" Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 87(12): 754-755. I've added a reference and link to this. I've also referenced and linked to a historically detailed critique of this position: Power C and Rasko J (2008). """"Whither Prometheus' Liver? Greek Myth and the Science of Regeneration."""" Annals of Internal Medicine 149(6): 421-426. This is by far the most comprehensive treatment of this topic.The addition of the above references made an existing reference redundant (ie Michalopoulos, George K., and DeFrances, Marie C., """"Liver regeneration? Science, 4 April 1997: Vol. 276. no. 5309, pp. 60-66), so I removed it. Like a great many articles on regenerative medicine, the Michalopoulos article simply asserts that the Greeks must have known about liver regeneration, citing the the myth of Prometheus as its only evidence. Chen and Chen go much further than this. Likewise Power and Rasko.   Gray's image While accurate, the Gray's image is of terrible resolution and greatly inferior to other freely available images. While this 19th century image is of historical significance, I believe a modern, perhaps scalable, image would be more appropriate for an encyclopedic article.  Invitation to editIt is proposed that Liver be part of the trial of a new template; see the green strip at the top of Pain where it has been in place for a couple of months.

I have to change the way I see Wikipedia or maybe I'll just leave, I dont know. I have to take some decisions, is what I meant.Xeno, if I have violated WP:POINT, is that a bigger offense than being rude and offensive? I dont understand how someone can be blocked for making a point, but not for saying things like """"what are you fucking on about"""" and all the other kinds of comments I gathered here. Isnt something wrong here? What is wrong is, I'll just say it: Jimbo's tolerance for rude and aggresive behavior. That may change if I get a reply from him but the fact that comments like the ones I gathered above, are being allowed to be said, without any punishment or enforcement of discipline and that, people are ok with, is a serious problem here. My """"violating"""" comment was to show that rude offensive comments are wrong and should be enforced. Thats exactly what I have proved. Did I violate WP:POINT? Actually I explicitly mentioned in my post that I was indeed trying to """"deliver a point"""" (to quote myself). The point was to show Bali that he did not like what I said because the way I said it. The problem is that such behavior is not being enforced. It is OK if I was blocked for my comment, if that was the only thing I said. The admin did the right thing. However what should have happened is that Bali should have been blocked (say even 12 hours is fine, a week would be excessive) in the first place and that did not happen. What is sad that we all couldnt even agree that rude and offensive behavior is punishable. Even George came and complained about Bali's rudeness but nothing was done and the issue was closed. As far as the enforcement of being respectful to other editors is concerned, I think its a sad state of affairs. I will be talking about the problem of rudeness at Wikipedia with more people here and outside Wikipedia.Taelus, the reason for the unblock is simple: I (obviously) did not mean what I said. I only said it to demonstrate that no one likes to be talked to in a rude, aggressive manner like Bali did (""""what are you fucking on about""""). Basically its absurd that I've been blocked for making a """"demo"""" post of rudeness while other editors go unpunished in real situations. In summary, my unblock reason is: """"I was kidding and trying to show an example.""""

I have fixed this. I also added the root ???-, which should only have the rough breathing as accent is not indicated for roots. Missing Ketone production ) In the article about Ketogenesis, it states """"Ketone bodies are produced mainly in the mitochondria of liver cells"""". This fact is missing from the functions of Liver.  黀receding unsigned comment added by 132.170.54.14    Liver regeneration and the Greeks On this page and the Prometheus page, someone has added a reference giving a bogus definition for the Greek word for liver, h?par, claiming that it  derives from the verb h?paomai, meaning to mend or repair. Thus h?par is supposed to translate as, """"repairable."""" This derivation is fanciful. I'm surprised it lasted as long on Wiki as it has since it wasn't even confirmed by the original source given! I've deleted this bogus definition. I doubt you need references for a deletion, but here are some anyway: J. Pokorny, Indogermanisches etymologisches W?rterbuch (Bern and Munich: Francke, 1959), pp. 325, 504; P. Chantraine, Dictionnaire ?tymologique de la lange grecque (Paris: Klincksieck, 1990), p. 414; H. Frisk, Griechisches etymologisches W?rterbuch, Vol. I (Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1973), pp. 638-9. These sources make it very doubtful that h?par was related to h?paomai.I've also changed some text in the section on Liver Regeneration which asserted that the myth of Prometheus proves that the ancient Greeks must have known about the liver's remarkable capacity to repair itself. Actually this is a matter of some dispute. I've changed the text to reflect this controversy. I黺e looked at a great deal of literature on the subject and have found only one attempt to actually argue that the Greeks knew about liver regeneration: Chen T and Chen P (1994). """"The Myth of Prometheus and the Liver."""" Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 87(12): 754-755. I've added a reference and link to this. I've also referenced and linked to a historically detailed critique of this position: Power C and Rasko J (2008). """"Whither Prometheus' Liver? Greek Myth and the Science of Regeneration."""" Annals of Internal Medicine 149(6): 421-426. This is by far the most comprehensive treatment of this topic.The addition of the above references made an existing reference redundant (ie Michalopoulos, George K., and DeFrances, Marie C., """"Liver regeneration? Science, 4 April 1997: Vol. 276. no. 5309, pp. 60-66), so I removed it. Like a great many articles on regenerative medicine, the Michalopoulos article simply asserts that the Greeks must have known about liver regeneration, citing the the myth of Prometheus as its only evidence. Chen and Chen go much further than this. Likewise Power and Rasko.   Gray's image While accurate, the Gray's image is of terrible resolution and greatly inferior to other freely available images. While this 19th century image is of historical significance, I believe a modern, perhaps scalable, image would be more appropriate for an encyclopedic article.  Invitation to editIt is proposed that Liver be part of the trial of a new template; see the green strip at the top of Pain where it has been in place for a couple of months.

Isnt something wrong here? What is wrong is, I'll just say it: Jimbo's tolerance for rude and aggresive behavior. That may change if I get a reply from him but the fact that comments like the ones I gathered above, are being allowed to be said, without any punishment or enforcement of discipline and that, people are ok with, is a serious problem here. My """"violating"""" comment was to show that rude offensive comments are wrong and should be enforced. Thats exactly what I have proved. Did I violate WP:POINT? Actually I explicitly mentioned in my post that I was indeed trying to """"deliver a point"""" (to quote myself). The point was to show Bali that he did not like what I said because the way I said it. The problem is that such behavior is not being enforced. It is OK if I was blocked for my comment, if that was the only thing I said. The admin did the right thing. However what should have happened is that Bali should have been blocked (say even 12 hours is fine, a week would be excessive) in the first place and that did not happen. What is sad that we all couldnt even agree that rude and offensive behavior is punishable. Even George came and complained about Bali's rudeness but nothing was done and the issue was closed. As far as the enforcement of being respectful to other editors is concerned, I think its a sad state of affairs. I will be talking about the problem of rudeness at Wikipedia with more people here and outside Wikipedia.Taelus, the reason for the unblock is simple: I (obviously) did not mean what I said. I only said it to demonstrate that no one likes to be talked to in a rude, aggressive manner like Bali did (""""what are you fucking on about""""). Basically its absurd that I've been blocked for making a """"demo"""" post of rudeness while other editors go unpunished in real situations. In summary, my unblock reason is: """"I was kidding and trying to show an example."""" Also as I mentioned to Xeno above, is making a POINT violation a more serious offense than being rude and aggressive?  (talk點ontribs) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

dfce2658f7a8800e,""" Long reply I'm afraid - hope it's helpful. It's possible - no people are flawless. But in fact it very rarely happens. I've been asked to investigate about 6 or so cases this last 9 months, by Irpen, Giano, Bishonen, at RFAR, on ANI, and others, but in most of those - in fact all but one or two in a nine month period, the channel actually functioned exactly as one would wish it to. The one case it didn't, I myself reported in full to the community at ANI, with full summary of the IRC dialog, so that it was made public in detail (a blocked admin had sought an unblock on dubious grounds, another admin had unblocked trusting that without sufficiently checking for themselves).  The problem with using """"IRC!"""" as a smokescreen is, those who go there know in fact it's extremely rare, so naturally it loses credibility and is seen as a way to further a """"politicized"""" agenda by those who have bad memories of IRC from years ago. We have an agreed structure to address problems in the channel, yet """"for whatever reason"""" those who feel there is a problem never actually come to me (or any channel operator) to have it resolved. They instead pass logs round, a move guaranteed to shed more heat, but not actually solve the problem. That to me says a lot; a person genuinely with a concern would ask to discuss it, and aim for resolution, just like any other dispute. These cases though are never used for dispute resolution, but only ever for dispute escalation. That seems to say something.  As for your specific question, again, yes, it's possible. But unlikely. Administrators, who undergo a quite strict and probing debate over their conduct and understanding of wiki-attitudes, are quite a varied bunch. They include diverse views - Bishonen, Lar, Coren, 1==2, myself, Carcharoth, to name but a few at random in this context. Any and all admins can go to that channel, and some 60 - 70 users on average are regularly there at any given time. They cover extreme diverse views too - to the point that no one stance can get much if any of a toehold there if it isn't proper. There will always be strong voices around.  RFA candidates will not be """"representative of the community as a whole"""". The community includes many vandals for example, under-represented at RFA, and many who understand policy well (probably over-represented at RFA). What is possible to say is, the users at #en-admins are probably representative of those users the community has deemed sufficiently trustworthy in judgement and clued in on wiki ethos, to use the tools. This shows in a few ways  for example, an outburst by a user (rare in itself) will often be addressed by general refusal to endorse it, and letting one or two users speak for everyone, or resolving in private chat to actually educate people how to handle things better, and that works very well. On-wiki, you'd get more people inclined to shout than fix. En-admins as a channel tends to look to fix problems by resolving them. When problems are visible, they get addressed.  They're also rather long suffering and (I suspect) used to the idea that bad faith will exist no matter what they say or do, and used to having their words pored over in a manner that nobody else would expect on-wiki, and misrepresented if necessary to create smoke. That's not ideal. It's a bit dysfunctional, as it encourages others to stir up problems that have little to no merit, make a large noise over a tiny number of tiny matters (major drama, someone used a bad word once and then when corrected by others agreed it was wrong a few minutes later, for example), to shout rather than approach those who might help, and so on. That kind of foolishness and """"hype"""" helps nobody. Lastly, it's worth noting that critically minded users play a very valuable role in that they can approach channel operators if they have concerns, on the spot, or indeed speak up in the channel. When they do, if it's merited, it is usually supported, and would indeed be the best way to effect disapproval or correction. I strongly encourage this, because I greatly suspect the number of cases that would be raised and found genuine would be very small, and they should be raised openly in the channel when noticed. But they probably only happen extremely rarely. To take an extreme case, suppose someone is present, believes an action is wrong, but says nothing, does nothing, and instead complains to a third party (non admin) who lacks all knowledge, but whom they encourage in a belief they have been conspired against. And all the time not broaching it in the channel, nor to any of the channel operators who have made their names known for exactly this purpose last month. This does the community a disservice. Such matters should be named openly to channel users, or privately to channel operators, if they are felt",0,0,0,0,0,0

The Queen has been faultless as far as I am aware in handling this juggling act. And part of the reason for that is because she does take her other roles very seriously. Apparently it sometimes annoys UK Prime Ministers when she swaps hats and speaks to them on behalf of some country other than the UK. They get an unfair advantage in that sense because the Queen meets with the UK Prime Minsister weekly.

e0cc0ac3dc539a27,"""The WWW.Weird World of WikipediaBy Martin J. WalkerFebruary 2006With this in mind, most people dealing with this issue, attempt to mitigate the problem by understanding that all knowledge is `situated' knowledge, and that all judgements come from a particular standpoint. This means that it is understood that no one can claim to be 100% ?eutral?or ?bjective? and that there are always power struggles involved when someone claims to be `objective` (especially whilst engaging in partisan behaviour).Angela Kennedy & Jane Bryant, The One Click Group to Jimmy Wales. 17 November 2005.http://www.theoneclickgroup.co.uk/documents/ME-CFS_docs/More%20Wikipedia%20On%20Wessely.docOne Click seems to me to be a bunch of paranoid zealots. And I   will state again that before I tried to tone down the shit they put on the Wessely page I had never heard of them or Simon Wessely. Just Z  G, you know? [T]/[C] AfD? 15:46, 19 December 2005http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Simon_WesselyA conservative estimate of the number of adults and children suffering from ME suggests that there are around 250,000 in the UK, yet it is rarely diagnosed by the medical profession, is fleetingly mentioned in government research funding documents, is seldom accepted by medical research workers, and is almost never admitted to by insurance companies. TABSince 1986, wh, while gathering around him an entourage of like minded disciples which has become known as the Wessely School, Professor Simon Wessely, has almost single-handedly been responsible for the strategy of a moratorium on the investigation of ME as an illness  with a physically neurological cause. Professor Wessely is a psychiatrist, and for nearly twenty years he has promulgated the idea that ME and the broader groupings of chronic fatigue illnesses (CFS) are the product of ?alse illness beliefs? mental aberrations, which can be diagnosed and treated with psychiatric based therapies and anti-depressants. TABProfessor Wessely carries out research mainly in the London-based Institute of Psychiatry which is situated in King? College teaching hospital. He is a member of numerous research organisations and advisory groups, and is advisor to the British Armed Services. While his membership of an ?fficial?web of research organisations tell us a lot about his work, added substance to his views is to be found in his more informal and less renowned associations with a number of minority-view groups set up by, or aligned with US and British ?uackbuster?organisations. TABJust before Christmas 2005, the Wikipedia, an electronic and sometimes publicly edited encyclopaedia, was host to a small, anonymous entry about Professor Wessely. The entry appeared to have originated with someone opposed to Wessely? psychiatric view of ME. On seeing this entry, Jane Bryant of the One Click (OClick (OC) campaign substituted a longer text, which contained not just biographical facts but a broader description of Wessely? role in the politics of ME. TABWhen this longer text was seen by the Wikipedia ?dit police?who cruise the pages seeking ?andalism?and 'skewed' edits, it was immediately considered to break most of Wikipedia? self serving rules. On writing to the owner and founder of Wikipedia, ?imbo?Wales, in an attempt to put their case, the OC campaign received a personal communication from him. Although Wales, aimed at a slight up-beat and reconciliatory tone in his e-mail, the text was scattered with veiled insults. He accused One Click participants of ?ehavioural problems? while stating that OC organisers had lied and purposefully made libellous statements in their posted piece on Wessely. He made clear even at this early stage of the exchange that Wikipedia would from then on act on the basis that ?nything from your site (will be treated) with extreme scepticism.?Jimbo Wales, ended his e-mail with an exhortation for everyone to settle differences and unit in the spirit of Wikichristmas. TABWhen, howeABWhen, however, OC answered Jimbo with a rebuttal of his argument in favour of an orthodox objectivity and neutrality ?黽e are not going to be advocates for or against either side in this dispute?- the debate entered another level.TABIt seems possible that Professor Wessely, having been alerted to his Wikipedia entry began to liaise with Wikipedia and the business of drafting a  Soviet-style biographical text about him was given to the indulgently named Just Zis  Guy, you know? (Clearly I have no intention of using this onanistic sobriquet in this essay and so will refer to him as ZG)TABThere ensued an argument, about One Click黶 contribution to the Wessely entry, which though handled with cool clear minded determ",0,0,0,0,0,0

e1296c9055578205,""" anti-Greek collusion occuring? I am new to Wikipedia. I've only been here a few days and I already get a strong sense of anti-Macedonian bias. (for the record when I say Macedonian... I'm talking about the ones that identify with Greece)I've already been threatened with banning and named called on more than one occasion for simply discussing facts on Macedonia. At this point I am loathe to name more names but it always appears to be the same set of people working together as a team. (I'm sure you know who some of them are) Anyhow... I have an interesting image that I think this is very relevant to the naming dispute article but I don't know how to upload it. Perhaps you could arrange it? (they should be allowable under fair use) I think the second one down """"Solun will be the capital of Macedonia again""""... perfectly illustrates Greek claims of FYROM irredentist behavior and would be an excellent example to add to the naming dispute page.http://history-of-macedonia.com/wordpress/category/fyrom-news/A secondary issue that bothers me is the Wikipedia page entitled """"ethnic Macedonians"""" related to FYROM (as if to say that Macedonians are now non-ethnic.) This of course is really offensive to Macedonians but the FYROM page is locked. I think the best approach around this lockout dismissing the human rights of 2.5 million ethnic Macedonians... it to make a new page called ethnic Macedonians (Greek)... which describes the rich history of the Macedonian identity... from ancient Macedon... to Byzantium... to integration with the new Greek state.... to distinct Pan=Macedonian foreign diasporas dating back decades. Many people only know Macedonians from Alexanders time... I think a page showing the long history of Greek speaking people calling themselves Macedonians would make it much clearer to readers why Macedonians are so sensitive to this name issue.'Talk' to you soon hopefully """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think I sent in several corrections to Standard Notes and Research Papers over the years then I just got bored with it. To take just one example, the SN refers to the 1935-1945 swing as being meaningless because """"National Labour candidates contributed 1.6% to the National total in 1935"""". True to say that but totally irrelevant: most voters in 1935 understood National Labour to be in effect Conservative, and it was only the Macdonald family which thought of it as being Labour. What the SN says when giving examples is no more definitive than a newspaper article and I absolutely refute that it is 'authoritative'.The reason why swing is used for Conservative and Labour only and not for any other parties is that it doesn't work properly for others. The calculation is only any use if you can take the result and apply it elsewhere to compare and contrast, and that only works for Conservative and Labour in practice.

When I made the graphics of the Australian and German Army, I based them on the future organization of these Armies (麳ardened and Networked Army?& """"Heer 2010"""") and if I could find a document, which will show, how the British Army will be structured after the ?rmy Plot?has been abolished, then I would do another attempt to finish the Graphic.About the Russian Ground Forces- let? do this -) If you have the information, I will do the graphic. What I need to know before I can begin the work is which units compromise which Brigades/ Divisions, where they are base, what kind of units they are?and so on.Strike-through textI.e: i had a look at the Moscow Military District and the infos that are missing are:2nd Tamanskaya Div: Are the regiments multi- or single battalion units? Is the 147th Guards Artillery Rgt. a self proplled unit?34th Guards Artillery Div: Which are its units? 27th Sevastopolskaya Guards Motor Rifle Brig. Which are its units? 20th Army: Are there any units directly under the Army Command?4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division: Perfect- with info like this my work becomes pure fun -)10th Guards Uralsko-Lvovskaya Tank Div: Where are its units based?22nd Army: same question as with the 20th Army3rd Vislenskaya Motor Rifle Div: Which are are its units? Operational Group of Russian Forces in Moldova (Tiraspol)(formerly Fourteenth Army) 8th Motor Rifle Brigade Which are its units? 16th Spetsnaz Brigade: Which are its units? A division-sized weapons and equipment storage base at Yelnya, the former 144 Guards MRD: A Divison sized *unit? In regards to the amount of men under command or the equipment stored? 16th Air Armyother formations and units: Which?As you see there is a lot of work involved in getting all the information together.

Tenebrae (talk) Civility warning IWhile we all offer edits which tend to improve the article, you need to exercise better caution in your edit summaries. [This] is not an example of civility; calling child is a fairly certain way to ensure your edits are met in the harshest possible light. In other words, knock off the bullshit sarcasm, or you won't like the ensuing discussion. - Jack Sebastian (talk) Allow me to be somewhat more clear: the next uncivil remark you make in an edit summary will find you taking a somewhat longer break than your previous block. We tend to block people for that sort of behavior. Consider my previous comment a request; consider this one a warning. - Jack Sebastian (talk) July 2012The edits you have been reverting have not been made in bad faith, so they are not vandalism.

Its completely incorrect, but nonetheless the only term which has ever been used to describe Coon's evolutionary model. Its incorrect because Howell's misinterpretated Weidenreich's polycentric (multiregional) origin of the races, which actually includes large amounts of gene-flow (regional interbreeding) when he wrongly believed it was a parallel (polygenic) model of the races. However Coon stressed far less on this gene-flow, but still allowed for it. So basically neither Weidenreich nor Coon's multiregionalism is true parallel or polygenic evolution, however Coon's model comes far closer to it, as his model doesn't take much interbreeding into account, his geneflow is very minimal. Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Human Evolution pp. 114-115 (see on google books) has a full discussion, pointing all this out. Coon also believed the racial developments and splits were long before sapienization, and that they were present in archaic homo and even earlier. If you read his Racial Adaptations (1982) he briefly discusses his idea that the Australopithecine's were already split into the races, for example he sees Mongoloid dental traits in one regional variation. However true polyphyletic or polygenism models on the origins of the races died out in the late 19th century. Karl Vogt for example argued the different races were never at any one point related, and that they evolved from different primates.",0,0,0,0,0,0

e219a6812ea5b920,""" My signature and your actions ~  I thought about taking this to a dispute hearing, but I couldn't be fucked.  So, I'm just going to outline here why I think that your blocking of my account was unjustified and against policy.  You stated when you blocked me, """"anon. only, account creation blocked) with an expiry time of indefinite (personal attack in signature - will unblock on signature change"""" .  I disagree with your action on three levels.  The first is that it was a personal attack, the second on the indefinite ban, and the third on any action at all.   Why it wasn't a personal attack """"The primary purpose of creating any block is to protect Wikipedia and its editors and users from harm."""" (From WP:BP).  Of the list of reasons, on WP:BP the only one plausibly applicable is """"Disruption"""".  Under this it has """"A user may be blocked when his/her conduct severely disrupts the project ?his/her conduct is inconsistent with a civil, collegial atmosphere and interferes with the process of editors working together harmoniously to create an encyclopedia.""""And """"Blocks for general incivility are controversial"""".In no way could any of my actions be considered """"severely"""" disruptive.  Or even simply disruptive.  While it could be argued that my signature was generally uncivil (and I disagree, more later), blocking for this reason is controversial and should have been discussed first.  So, from WP:BP there is no reason (in my opinion) to block.  Now we examine WP:NPA.  This is simply, """"Do not make personal attacks anywhere in Wikipedia"""" and I agree with it.  The point here is """"personal"""".  My signature was not a personal attack on anyone.  It was a generalised comment and an """"in joke"""" (I can't help it if you are not in on the joke).  For the """"attack"""" to be personal, you would need to find someone who was """"attacked"""", you would not be able to do this.  So, my signature did not constitute an attack on anyone, it did not disrupt discussion or affect the quality of my edits, thus it should not be a factor in anything.  As to general incivility, I simply disagree.  From WP:CIVIL, """"Whereas incivility is roughly defined as personally targeted behavior that causes an atmosphere of greater conflict and stress"""".  My signature was not """"personally targeted behavior"""" (as explained above), and I also fail to see how it could cause an atmosphere of """"conflict"""" or """"stress"""".  There is nothing in this policy which is applicable in this case. Why I should not have been blocked In blocking me indefinitely, you violated WP:BP which states, """"Established users with significant constructive edits should not be indefinitely blocked except when there is a community ban. In all other cases, they should be handled with appropriate time-limited blocks or arbitration. Indefinite blocks should not usually be placed on IP users (whether individual IPs or IP ranges) in order to avoid inadvertently blocking legitimate users.""""In blocking me at all, I also feel that you violated WP:BP.  You did not have a clear reason to block me, and you did so indefinitely.  In these cases, you should have posted at WP:ANI asking for advice and/or detailing why you felt that the block was needed. What could have happened So, what could you have done?  Well, the simplest thing would have to post on my talk page a comment asking me to change my signature and pointing to the policy which it violated (see the previous case for an example).  If you had have done this (and I had agreed with your argument) then I would have simply changed my signature.  If I had failed to change my signature, then you could have discussed it with me more, and/or taken it to a hearing.    Conclusion As I said at the beginning, I didn't want to take this to a hearing.  However, I feel that I would be perfectly within my rights to do so, and I reserve the right to do so.  This, by the way, is simply a statement.  What would I like you to do?  Well, an apology would be nice, perhaps something worded along the lines of """"I'm sorry for not talking to you first, not checking policy and for violating policy by indefinitely blocking you"""".  If you are unable to give an apology (for whatever reason, say you believe that you were in the right and still are), then I would appreciate a comment regardless.  A comment on my userpage would be noticed faster, but here would be fine as well.   Postscripts PS This is the first time I've encountered you, but I notice that you objected to my comments at the Talk:Tasmania[http://en.w",0,0,0,0,0,0

e22579f11408bf7c,""", 5 August 2012 (UTC)I did find it surprising that nowhere is due process mentioned in Arbcom's procedures. There is a fourth problem that hasn't previously been mentioned which is the lack of any practicable route of appeal for Arbcom's decisions. Yes, in theory Jimbo is the final """"court of appeal"""" but that is not a route which anyone takes seriously, as far as I can tell. In practical terms the only recourse is to appeal to Arbcom itself, but how likely is it that Arbcom will admit that it's got something wrong? If Arbcom's conduct during a case has thrown due process out of the window, what is the likelihood that it will find itself at fault? Human pride and institutional defensiveness, if nothing else, will count against it. Right now, if Arbcom commits an abuse of process there is no way of correcting it other than voting out the offending arbitrators, which could take years depending in which tranche of elections they're due to come up for a vote. There is no process for anyone other than Arbcom to review cases, nor for egregious mishandling of a case to be tackled. In effect we have a single """"accountability moment"""" once a year and there is no accountability, no recourse and no effective oversight of how they have conducted themselves. What is needed, I think, is a much stricter set of rules governing what Arbcom does, combined with an independent appeals procedure that is empowered to review Arbcom's own conduct and set aside remedies if they have been passed without due process being followed.   16:11""",0,0,0,0,0,0

On September 12, he gave a speech in the White House Rose Garden in front of a group of teachers, police officers, construction workers and small-business owners in which he stated that """"if Congress does not act, just about every family in America will pay more taxes next year. That would be a self-inflicted wound that our economy just cannot afford right now."""" In Speaker Boehner's home state of Ohio, Obama gave a speech described as """"fiery"""" in a Columbus high school that led to the audience chanting: """"Pass this bill!"""" In a campaign-style rally at North Carolina State University, Obama told college students """"Every single one of you can help make this bill a reality. ?The time for hand-wringing is over. The time for moping around is over. We've got to kick off our bedroom slippers and put on our marching shoes."""" At a black-tie dinner for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, Obama pitched his jobs plan to Latinos. In anticipation of criticism that the legislation was motivated by the upcoming election, the President noted that the election is fourteen months away and that Americans do not have the luxury of waiting fourteen months for jobs to be created.Re item #1 I propose we tack it onto the very end of the paragraph with a sentence like """"Some of the criticism refers to Obama's own remarks, including past statements that he will (blank blank blank)"""" (I won't complete the sentence, but just letting you overlook my generalized proposal.)

e2a35ba86bacfac8,""" A beating Hello Shovon, I see you've taken quite a beating dealing with some trolls regarding the Kashmir issue. As a piece of advice, just don't entertain (feed) trolls because this only increases our pressure. Who cares, let them call us """"Hindu facist"""" or """"faggot"""" or whatever because that only reflects on the person making those remarks, and needless to say, their country. Such actions speak a thousand words and it's foolhardy for us to waste our time and energy feeding such trolls. I avoided naming this section """"Kashmir"""" fearing you wouldn't give a damn! Have a cookie in the mean time. Take care. ?""",0,0,1,0,0,1
