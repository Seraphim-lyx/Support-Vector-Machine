# Support-Vector-Machine

Simple implementation of support vector machine based on sequential minimal optimization(smo) algorithm.

Optional kernel: linear, gaussian(rbf), polynomial(poly).

X -> two dimension data set.

y -> one dimension data set.

Data is better to process in numpy array.

The numpy array must be set to 'int' if data is in integer format, 
otherwise unpredictable calculation error will occur during processing
